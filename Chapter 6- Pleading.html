<p id="c0b4440c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our system depends on the parties to move lawsuits forward. Pleadings—the ­plaintiff’s complaint and the defendant’s response to that complaint—constitute the first steps. Eighty years ago, the bulk of a course in civil procedure would have consisted of learning the special formulas necessary to bring thirty or so kinds of claims, each of which had a special, formulaic pleading associated with it. Today, for reasons you’ll soon see, pleading again stands on center stage, with some claiming that recent judicial interpretations of the Rules have thrown pleading, and, with it, the entire litigation system, into disarray. This chapter aims to describe the changing role of pleading, its current functions, and the sources of the present uncertainty.</p>
<p id="c0b4440d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Let’s start with basics: What <i>is</i> a “pleading”? Rule 7(a) defines that term to include the complaint, the answer, and some other initial papers in a lawsuit. Rule 7(b) distinguishes between “pleadings” and “motions,” the latter term used to describe any “request for a court order.” But, to make things a bit more challenging, sometimes lawyers or judges will describe the “pleading stage” of a lawsuit to include both the papers formally defined as pleadings <i>and</i> various motions challenging the sufficiency of the pleadings. This chapter will deal with both.</p>

They allow the opposing party—via motions—to ask the court to provide rough blueprints for the next steps in litigation. In contemporary practice, pleadings also open the door to the very powerful tools of discovery explored in the next chapter. That’s a lot to expect from an initial exchange of documents, and sometimes they fail in one or all of these functions. Moreover, these functions sometimes work at cross-purposes with one another, and the common law system has over the past millennium emphasized now one, now another of these functions.</p>

<p id="c0b49248-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>The Court of Common Pleas, Depicted in a Fifteenth-Century Manuscript</b></p>
<p id="c0b49249-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The king’s greeting to the sheriff provides one example. In medieval England right after the Norman Conquest (in 1066), royal justice (administered by the king, his sheriffs and judges) was special, something extraordinary. Ordinary cases were to be dealt with in local courts and would not involve royal officials. Plaintiffs who wanted to get royal justice—and many did because it quickly gained a reputation as fairer, faster, and generally more efficacious—had to take two steps. First, they had to convince the royal officials that the case was one that warranted royal justice. In early medieval times, this question was debated. Everyone agreed that the royal courts should attend to allegations of breaches of the peace—what today we might call violent crime. Even as royal justice extended to more <span title="364" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-364">p. 364</span>"peaceful” forms of unlawfulness—failure to pay debts, breach of contract, and negligent injury—the pleadings retained the flavor of outrage. The defendant has not merely failed to keep his word or pay his debt; he has made things worse. Can you see this in the first pleading?</p>
<p id="c0b4924a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second thing the plaintiff seeking royal justice had to do was to pay for it. Administering justice was a source of income to the crown, and a plaintiff wanting access to the royal courts had to pay. The writ issued only when the fee was paid, and the “greeting” to the sheriff was also an assurance that the royal coffers had received the right number of shillings—what we would call today a filing fee—from the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="c0b4924b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another striking characteristic of medieval royal justice was that—except in cases involving land—there was no such thing as a default judgment: The defendant had to appear for the court to proceed further. Defendants who thought they might lose were understandably reluctant to appear, and so early common law procedure devoted much effort to “encouraging” them to appear. The first stage was, as now, for the sheriff to summon them, and to require that they give him some assurance that they would show up on the date set for trial. The complaint sets the “octave of St. Michael,” the week after the feast of St. Michael, on September 29, as the time when the defendant should appear before “us,” meaning not the king (though in the Middle Ages the king himself occasionally heard lawsuits) but the royal justices. Defendants assured their appearance in court by two means—by posting what we would now call a bond, called a “gage” (bail bonds are still common in criminal cases, where they assure that defendant will appear) as well as by supplying persons, known as “pledges,” who would personally promise to assure defendant’s appearance. The writ above thus refers to “gages and safe pledges.”</p>

<ol class="epub-list-reset2 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="c0b4924c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider now the modern pleading. It is addressed to the court, not to the sheriff, and, because we now have default judgments, it omits gages, pledges, and the like. On the other hand, it begins with a recitation of the state citizenship of the two parties, something that seems quite peripheral to the question of whether Jones’s negligence caused Smith’s injuries.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0b4924d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In fact, that allegation is analogous to the king’s greeting to the sheriff: It establishes the court’s jurisdiction. Twenty-first-century federal courts are like medieval royal courts in one respect: They have limited jurisdiction. One basis for that jurisdiction is “diversity of citizenship,” defined in the Constitution and in 28 U.S.C. §1332, to which the complaint refers. Note that state court complaints do not generally include a jurisdictional statement as they, in contrast to federal courts, are courts of general jurisdiction—meaning that they can hear all cases, unless a provision of state or federal law restricts their jurisdiction.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b4924e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the medieval complaint was focused on getting the defendant to appear, the modern one seems more concerned with the other end of the lawsuit—the nature of injuries and amount of damages claimed by the plaintiff. As we’ll see, this “factuality” and a focus on remedies are hallmarks of modern lawsuits.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b4b95f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="365" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-365">p. 365</span>The ingredients of a modern complaint are relatively straightforward. Rule 8(a) contains the recipe—a recitation of the basis for jurisdiction, a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,” and “a demand for judgment for the relief sought.” The modern recipe is simple. But just as it is deceptively simple to say that a recipe for a soufflé involves only a sauce and some eggs, drafting a complaint requires a bit of art; for most of the rest of this chapter, we’ll see instances in which lawyers managed to mess up the recipe and what consequences flowed from their mistakes.</p></li>

<p id="c0b4b962-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before we go further, keep firmly in mind that the process of pleading, like civil litigation generally, involves <i>competitive</i> storytelling. The plaintiff has his tale of woe and outrage, but the defendant typically has a very different version of the events, suggesting that the plaintiff’s story is wrong in one of several ways. By far the most common defendant’s response, contained in the defendant’s first pleading, called the “answer,” has been the same for centuries: “I didn’t do it” or “That’s not what happened.” At common law this defense was known as a “traverse” (derived from the Latin sense of “running against"); today it’s known as a denial, and finds expression in Rule 8(b).</p>
<p id="c0b4b963-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But both common law and modern procedure offer a set of more technical, “legal” responses. We’ll meet most of them in the course of this chapter. Some have to do with the power of the court to hear the case, others with some defect in the way the plaintiff commenced the lawsuit. Rule 12(b) lists a series of such defenses and allows a defendant to assert each as a motion. These motions all have one important feature in common: They do not require the defendant to say whether the allegations of the complaint are true. Instead, they state that the case has some other defect that should cause the court to dismiss it before the defendant has to answer.</p>
<p id="c0b4b964-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the more powerful Rule 12(b) motions essentially says that the plaintiff’s “story” doesn’t matter—doesn’t matter because the plaintiff has not told one of the stories that would allow a court to grant a legal remedy. For example, suppose defendant promised to come to plaintiff’s party, but failed to show up. However unhappy the disappointed host may be, that story is not one that will cause a court to award damages or other remedy. It’s different if the defendant is the caterer and contracted to supply food, but against the invited guest who decides the weather is too bad to attend, the law provides no remedy.</p>
<p id="c0b4b965-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This motion—plaintiff’s story doesn’t matter, or “so what?"—had the name at common law, and still in some state procedural codes, of “demurrer” (from Latin and French words meaning “delay"); the Rules call this a 12(b)(6) motion. It does two things. First, it admits, for the purposes of the motion, all the facts alleged in the complaint: So if, as in the party invitation example, the plaintiff alleges that he suffered great emotional distress when the defendant failed to show up, a defendant’s 12(b)(6) motion admits that distress for the purposes of the motion. Second, the 12(b)(6) motion says that <i>even if all the facts alleged are true</i>, the law grants plaintiff no legal remedy—a fancier way of saying that plaintiff’s story doesn’t matter legally. So when a defendant demurs to a complaint (or, under the Rules, files a 12(b)(6) motion), the question facing the court is whether, assuming the pleaded facts are <span title="366" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-366">p. 366</span>true, the law provides any remedy. The first several cases in this chapter involve 12(b)(6) motions—and the issue is why the law provides a remedy (or why it doesn’t), assuming plaintiff can prove what he alleges—and what the decision of that question tells us about the rules and principles of modern pleading.</p>

<p id="c0b4e080-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. Plaintiff is a citizen and resident of the State of Georgia.</p>
<p id="c0b4e081-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2. Defendant Garrison is a resident of the State of South Carolina.</p>

<p id="c0b4e083-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">4. Defendant Healthmaster is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Georgia with its principal place of business within the Southern District of Georgia.</p>
<p id="c0b4e084-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">5. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court over Count I of this Complaint (the Civil Rights Act of 1871) by virtue of 28 U.S.C. §1331. Jurisdiction over Count II (Georgia RICO), Count III (Tortious Interference) and Count IV (Fraudulent Conveyance) is proper in this Court because these Counts are pendent to Count I.</p>
<p id="c0b4e085-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">6. Venue is proper in this Court in that most Defendants reside within the Southern District of Georgia and in that the actions of all Defendants as alleged below occurred within the Southern District of Georgia.</p>

<p id="c0b4e087-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">7. From September 22, 1986 until approximately April 13, 1995, Plaintiff was employed by Defendant Healthmaster.</p>
<p id="c0b4e088-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">8. From approximately April 13, 1995, until his discharge as alleged below, Plaintiff was employed by Healthmaster Home Health Care, Inc., a Georgia corporation whose stock is owned entirely by Defendant Healthmaster.</p>
<p id="c0b50799-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="367" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-367">p. 367</span>9. Defendant Garrison has at all relevant times owned 50% of the stock of Healthmaster and controlled Healthmaster until April or May, 1995, when a trustee was appointed for Healthmaster, then a debtor in possession under Chapter II of the federal Bankruptcy Code, by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Georgia.</p>
<p id="c0b5079a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">10. The individual Defendants herein have all served in various capacities as corporate officers and directors of Defendant Healthmaster and of Healthmaster Home Health Care, Inc.</p>
<p id="c0b5079b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">11. Defendant Molloy has at all relevant times been employed by Defendant Healthmaster or Healthmaster Home Health Care, Inc.</p>
<p id="c0b5079c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">12. On March 8, 1995, a grand jury convened in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, Augusta Division, filed an indictment against Defendants Garrison, Kelly, Healthmaster, and others charging a total of 133 counts of fraud against various defendants, which indictment is enumerated as number CR-195-11 in this Court.</p>
<p id="c0b5079d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">13. Although not indicted, Defendant Molloy was, on information and belief, a target of the ongoing criminal investigation.</p>
<p id="c0b5079e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">14. Plaintiff cooperated with the investigation by federal agents which preceded this indictment and testified pursuant to subpoena before said grand jury and appeared pursuant to subpoena to testify before said grand jury, although his testimony was not actually taken due to the press of time.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101A0_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N101A0_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*1</a></span></p>
<p id="c0b507a0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">15. As a result of their indictment, Defendants Garrison and Kelly were banned from any participation in the affairs of Healthmaster Home Health Care, Inc., by order of said Bankruptcy Court.</p>
<p id="c0b507a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">16. On June 21, 1995, after Defendants had become aware that Plaintiff would appear as a witness at the criminal trial of Indictment No. CR 195-11, Defendant Molloy, who was then President of Defendant Healthmaster, having been retained in said position by the trustee, but acting at the direction of Defendants Garrison and Kelly and pursuant to a prior understanding and agreement between these three persons, terminated Plaintiff from his employment at Healthmaster Home Health Care, Inc.</p>

<p id="c0b507a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">18. The decision to terminate Plaintiff was made by Defendants and others not in furtherance of the business interests of Defendant Healthmaster, but instead for the purpose of retaliating against Plaintiff for his cooperation with federal agents and his testimony under subpoena to the federal grand jury, and in order to intimidate Plaintiff and others from cooperating with federal agents or testifying in any criminal matters against them including said indictment.</p>
<p id="c0b507a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">19. Defendants participated in and carried out the decision to terminate Plaintiff, not in furtherance of the business interests of Defendant Healthmaster, but rather to protect themselves as criminal defendants or potential criminal defendants.</p>
<p id="c0b507a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">20. By means of the described actions, and their agreement and plan to do the same, Defendants have violated 42 U.S.C. §1985(2), in that they have conspired within the State of Georgia to deter, by force, intimidation or threat, a party or witness in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, from attending such court, or from testifying in any matter pending therein, freely, fully, and truthfully, or to injure such party or witness in his person or property on account of his having so attended or testified, or to influence the verdict, presentment, or indictment of the grand jurors of such court.</p>

<p id="c0b507a8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">22. Because said Defendants’ acts were willful, intentional and malicious, Plaintiff is entitled to recover punitive damages against Defendants jointly and severally.</p>
<p id="c0b52eb9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">23. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1988, Plaintiff is entitled to recover his expenses of litigation including a reasonable attorney’s fee from said Defendants jointly and severally.</p>

And the plaintiff has obviously supplied a good deal more detail than you might guess from reading the “short and plain statement” requirement of Rule 8(a). Why?</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0b555d9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Part of the answer lies in the role of pleading as storytelling. A pleader who has a good story will want to tell it, even if no Rule or case compels him to. This additional detail will show the strengths of the case to the trial judge deciding the case, the defendants, and even, perhaps, the press.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b555da-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, this is a case in which many relevant facts will be known to the plaintiff. (Not all: Haddle will have no idea what might have been said about him in discussions of his job performance among defendants.) Since he knows part of the story, why not tell it in a way that puts him in the most attractive—and the defendants in the least attractive—light possible?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b555db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Haddle has an intuitively attractive story: As he sees it, he was just trying to do the right thing—cooperating with a government investigation of criminal activity—and was fired for it. But not all attractive stories constitute legal claims.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0b555dc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some states recognize “wrongful discharge” claims; an employee alleging that she was fired without good cause states a wrongful discharge claim. But Georgia at the time of Haddle’s case did not recognize such a claim.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b555dd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So Haddle’s lawyer had to look elsewhere. He started with a statute enacted in the wake of the Civil War and aimed at those who sought to intimidate newly freed former slaves by preventing them from using courts to enforce newly granted rights. That statute, now codified as 42 U.S.C. §1985(2), provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0b555de-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire to deter, by force, ­intimidation, or threat, any party or witness in any court of the United States from attending such court, or from testifying to any matter pending therein, freely, fully, and truthfully, or to injure such party or witness in his person or property on account of his having so attended or testified. . . . the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages, occasioned by such injury or deprivation, against any one or more of the conspirators.</p>
</div></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b555df-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How did Haddle’s lawyer turn his grievance into a claim based on §1985(2)? Identify the key sections of the complaint that reframe Haddle’s story as a violation of the statute.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b555e0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now suppose you represent Jeanette Garrison, the defendant. Your client tells you that she did not fire Haddle in retaliation for his grand jury testimony, but for other reasons. You might respond to the complaint by simply filing an answer containing this denial and then proceed toward discovery and trial. But in this case there are two powerful reasons for seeking another solution if it is available.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0b555e1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="370" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-370">p. 370</span>This will be what lawyers call a “he said, she said” case, in which the parties and allied witnesses will present differing versions of the facts and ask a jury to decide whose is most believable. Such factual disputes are both uncertain and expensive to try: There will be depositions of employees, supervisors, and officers of the parties—each deposition likely costing thousands of dollars in lawyer time and deposition expense.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b57cf2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants had a special reason for wanting to avoid a “swearing contest” (so called because witnesses are under oath): In the time since the complaint was filed Jeanette Garrison had pleaded guilty to federal felony charges. If defendants go to trial, they will be asking the jury to believe the testimony of a criminal in a case where, on cross-examination, the plaintiff will be able to introduce the following testimony from Jeanette Garrison before the U.S. Senate Committee on Aging:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0b57cf3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">My name is Jeanette Garrison. I am a nurse by training. I am married to Joseph Garrison, a now retired anesthesiologist. . . . I was the Chair of the Board and President of Healthmaster, Inc., a Medicare paid home health care company. I also am a convicted felon. I pleaded guilty in July 1995 to ten (10) counts of Medicare fraud. My company and I have repaid the federal and state government sixteen million five hundred thousand dollars ($16,500,000.). I currently am serving a thirty-three (33) month sentence in a federal prison.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0b57cf4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So, if there is a defense that will not involve a credibility contest between the defendants and the plaintiff, defendants’ lawyers would like to take advantage of it.</p>
</li>

<li class=""><p id="c0b57cf5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is there? Look carefully again at the statute on which the complaint is based, 42 U.S.C. §1985(2). Read it like defendants’ lawyers, who are seeking to attack the complaint.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0b57cf6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As already noted, the statute requires a conspiracy by two or more persons; clearly Haddle’s complaint meets those criteria.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b57cf7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is it that the two or more persons must do to trigger liability? Here the statute has two branches: The first focuses on deterring (by force, intimidation, or threat) anyone from testifying in a court proceeding. The second branch speaks of retaliation for having done so.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b57cf8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the statute grants a remedy to the party injured “in his person or property.”</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b57cf9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under Georgia law, any employment agreement that is not for a specified term is considered to be “at will"—that is, terminable by the employer for any reason or for no reason at all. Haddle did not have an employment contract for a specific term. Based on the preceding analysis, defense counsel constructed an argument for the defendants that—however unadmirable their actions may have been—those actions did not violate §1985(2).</p></li>

<p id="c0b5a414-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff, Michael A. Haddle, has brought the current litigation seeking damages under Section 1985(2) of Title 42 of the United States Code, and state law. Presently before the Court are four [defendants’] motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the reasons stated below, Defendants’ motions will be Granted.</p>

<p id="c0b5a419-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 12(b)(6) permits a defendant to move to dismiss a complaint on the grounds that the plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. A motion under Rule 12(b)(6) attacks the legal sufficiency of the complaint. In essence, the movant says, “Even if everything you allege is true, the law affords you no relief.” Consequently, in determining the merits of a 12(b)(6) motion, a court <span title="372" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-372">p. 372</span>must assume that all of the factual allegations of the complaint are true. A court should not dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim unless it is clear that the plaintiff can prove “no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.” Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957).</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0b5f24b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is it reasonable to treat the complaint as conceding that Haddle was an at-will employee because it does not allege that his employment was for a specified term? Is it possible that the concession the district court refers to was made somewhere other than in the complaint itself? Imagine oral argument on the motion to dismiss, at which the judge asked Haddle’s lawyer if he was contending that his client had some form of protected employment. The lawyer says no. At that point the judge could ask that the complaint be amended to make that clear or could simply treat the concession as part of the pleading as it stood.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b5f24c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To distinguish a 12(b)(6) motion from other attacks on plaintiff’s claim, imagine some alternative scenarios. Suppose the defendants had moved to dismiss on the ground that Haddle had quit his job and had not been fired, and defendants had submitted in support of the motion a letter signed by Haddle admitting he had quit. Explain why, in such a scenario, the district court could not have granted a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). It would, instead, be handled under Rule 12(d), to which we will soon turn.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b5f24d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In both state and federal courts, when a complaint fails to state a claim, the court will almost always allow the plaintiff “leave to amend"—meaning a chance to add allegations to the complaint that would render it valid. If the plaintiff seeks leave, and if the court denies it, an appellate court will likely reverse on the grounds that failure to grant leave to amend the complaint is an abuse of discretion.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0b5f24e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet, in the district court’s opinion above, the judge makes no mention of leave to amend. That’s very likely because Haddle’s lawyer did not seek such leave—because he thought that he had already pleaded all the facts he truthfully could, and it would thus be futile to try to amend the complaint.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b5f24f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, if the court had granted leave to amend, Haddle’s lawyer could have added allegations that his contract stated he would not be dismissed except for good cause. Given that these allegations are untrue, there’s a good reason Haddle’s lawyer did not thus amend the complaint (as you will see later in this chapter, when we discuss Rule 11).</p></li>

<p id="c0b66799-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner Michael A. Haddle, an at-will employee, alleges that respondents conspired to have him fired from his job in retaliation for obeying a federal grand jury subpoena and to deter him from testifying at a federal criminal trial. We hold that such interference with at-will employment may give rise to a claim for damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Rev. Stat. §1980, 42 U.S.C. §1985(2).</p>
<p id="c0b6679a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to petitioner’s complaint, a federal grand jury indictment in March 1995 charged petitioner’s employer, Healthmaster, Inc., and respondents Jeanette Garrison and Dennis Kelly, officers of Healthmaster, with Medicare fraud. Petitioner cooperated with the federal agents in the investigation that preceded the indictment. He also appeared to testify before the grand jury pursuant to a subpoena, but did not testify due to the press of time. Petitioner was also expected to appear as a witness in the criminal trial resulting from the indictment.</p>
<p id="c0b6679b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Garrison and Kelly were barred by the Bankruptcy Court from participating in the affairs of Healthmaster, they conspired with G. Peter Molloy, Jr., one of the remaining officers of Healthmaster, to bring about petitioner’s termination. They did this both to intimidate petitioner and to retaliate against him for his attendance at the federal-court proceedings.</p>
<p id="c0b6679c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner sued for damages in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, asserting a federal claim under 42 U.S.C. §1985(2) and various state-law claims. Petitioner stated two grounds for relief under §1985(2): one for conspiracy to deter him from testifying in the upcoming criminal trial and one for conspiracy to retaliate against him for attending the grand jury proceedings. As §1985 demands, he also alleged that he had been “injured in his person or property” by the acts of respondents in violation of §1985(2) and that he was entitled to recover his damages occasioned by such injury against respondents jointly and severally.</p>
<p id="c0b6679d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Because petitioner conceded that he was an at-will employee, the District Court granted the motion on the authority of Morast v. Lance, 807 F.2d 926 (1987). In <i>Morast</i>, the Eleventh Circuit held that an at-will employee who is dismissed pursuant to a conspiracy proscribed by §1985(2) has no cause of action. The <i>Morast</i> court <span title="376" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-376">p. 376</span>explained that “to make out a cause of action under §1985(2) the plaintiff must have suffered an actual injury. Because Morast was an at-will employee, he had no constitutionally protected interest in continued employment. Therefore, Morast’s discharge did not constitute an actual injury under this statute.” Relying on its decision in <i>Morast</i>, the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>
<p id="c0b6679e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Eleventh Circuit’s rule in <i>Morast</i> conflicts with the holdings of the First and Ninth Circuits. We therefore granted certiorari, to decide whether petitioner was “injured in his property or person” when respondents induced his employer to terminate petitioner’s at-will employment as part of a conspiracy prohibited by §1985(2).</p>
<p id="c0b6679f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute provides that if one or more persons engaged in such a conspiracy “do, or cause to be done, any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or property,. . . . the party so injured. . . . may have an action for the recovery of damages occasioned by such injury. . . . against any one or more of the conspirators.” §1985(3).</p>
<p id="c0b667a0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner’s action was dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) because, in the Eleventh Circuit’s view, he had not suffered an injury that could give rise to a claim for damages under §1985(2). We must, of course, assume that the facts as alleged in petitioner’s complaint are true and that respondents engaged in a conspiracy prohibited by §1985(2). Our review in this case is accordingly confined to one question: Can petitioner state a claim for damages by alleging that a conspiracy proscribed by §1985(2) induced his employer to terminate his at-will employment.</p>
<p id="c0b667a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We disagree with the Eleventh Circuit’s conclusion that petitioner must suffer an injury to a “constitutionally protected property interest” to state a claim for damages under §1985(2). Nothing in the language or purpose of the proscriptions in the first clause of §1985(2), nor in its attendant remedial provisions, establishes such a requirement. The gist of the wrong at which §1985(2) is directed is not deprivation of property, but intimidation or retaliation against witnesses in federal-court proceedings. The terms “injured in his person or property” define the harm that the victim may suffer as a result of the conspiracy to intimidate or retaliate. Thus, the fact that employment at will is not “property” for purposes of the Due Process Clause, does not mean that loss of at-will employment may not “injur[e] [petitioner] in his person or property” for purposes of §1985(2).</p>
<p id="c0b667a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that the sort of harm alleged by petitioner here—essentially third-party interference with at-will employment relationships—states a claim for relief under §1985(2). Such harm has long been a compensable injury under tort law, and we see no reason to ignore this tradition in this case. As Thomas Cooley recognized:</p>

See Restatement (Second) of Torts §766, Comment g, pp. 10-11 (1977); see also id., §766B, Comment c, at 22. This protection against third-party interference with at-will employment relations is still afforded by state law today. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keaton on Law of Torts §129, pp. 995-996, and n. 83 (5th ed. 1984) (citing cases). For example, the State of Georgia, where the acts underlying the complaint in this case took place, provides a cause of action against third parties for wrongful interference with employment relations.</p>
<p id="c0b68eb8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, to the extent that the terms “injured in his person or property” in §1985 refer to principles of tort law, see 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 118 (1768) (describing the universe of common law torts as “all private wrongs, or civil injuries, which may be offered to the rights of either a man’s person or his property"), we find ample support for our holding that the harm occasioned by the conspiracy here may give rise to a claim for damages under §1985(2).</p>

But in the same verdict, the jury awarded Mr. Haddle just $65,000 in compensatory damages against Jeannette Garrison, founder and owner of the now-defunct Healthmaster Inc., the company, and her corporate legal counsel and top executive, G. Peter Molloy. “You won again,” defense attorney David Hudson told Mrs. Garrison after the jury verdict was announced at the conclusion of a five-day federal court trial. The low amount of damages left the defense team in smiles, extremely pleased with the jury’s decision about damages. But they still intend to challenge the verdict, Mr. Hudson said. Afterward, Mr. Haddle smiled, too. “I’m pleased with the verdict. It vindicated me. “Sometimes those things are more important than money.”</p>

<p id="c0b6b5db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The article went on to report that the verdict was several hundred thousand dollars less than plaintiff had sought.

Before the civil trial began in December, Judge Alaimo found that Mr. Bradley and Mr. Armstrong, who represented Mrs. Garrison, had violated a specific court order to turn over evidence to Mr. Haddle’s attorneys.

As you saw in Chapter 1, there are several other procedural moments that require a court to set forth the law: motions for summary judgment and judgments as a matter of law, jury instructions—and more. The 12(b)(6) motion is the first of these moments and has some special characteristics. Notably, a court ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion is uncontaminated by disputed facts. It has the allegations in the complaint, but these are only allegations, and any judge worth her salt <span title="380" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-380">p. 380</span>understands that the defendant will deny many of these allegations in the answer and contest them in ensuing stages of litigation. But that hasn’t yet happened at the 12(b)(6) stage. Consequently, a judge ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion is operating in a hypothetical world: “<i>If</i> this were true, how would the law respond?”</p>

<p id="c0b6b5e4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Haddle</i> shows us how complaints and Rule 12(b)(6) challenges to them help define the substantive law. But pleadings sometimes aspire to other tasks as well. Lawsuits take a toll in time, money, and emotions. That toll is worth its price if a suit has merit; if, that is, events have occurred for which the law grants a remedy. If, on the other hand, the suit has no merit because the plaintiff cannot show that the events alleged actually occurred, then the toll of litigation seems excessive. Suppose it were possible to tell from the face of a complaint whether it would ultimately fail: Would it not be a good thing to put such a lawsuit out of its misery at the earliest possible moment?</p>
<p id="c0b6b5e5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the past several centuries, courts, legislators, and designers of procedural systems have taken several approaches to this problem. At common law, say from 1100 <span class="epub-small-caps">c.e</span>. to the mid-nineteenth century, pleading was in one respect easy: One simply recited the formula for one of the “approved” 30-odd writs, each of which came both with its required allegations and with its own mode of proof. In common law, pleadings problems arose when the pleader tried to prove something that didn’t exactly match the allegations of the pleading. Suppose, for example, that, having pleaded a claim of having injured his horse, our medieval John Smith then wanted to prove something a bit more subtle: that the blacksmith had promised “first-class work” (or whatever its Middle English equivalent would be) but that the horse was lamed when the shoe fell off after just one day’s riding. Could Smith make that proof having pleaded something else? (The answer mattered a lot because if Smith had pleaded what we would think of as a breach of warranty claim, the defendant Jones would not have to go before a jury, but could defend himself by showing up with a sufficient number of “oath-helpers,” who would, perhaps for the price of tankard of ale, swear that Jones had done good work—and that would be the end of the claim.) Locked into the writs’ formulae, weak complaints were impossible to distinguish from strong ones before trial.</p>
<p id="c0b6b5e6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reaction to this problem, the great pleading reform of the nineteenth century was to junk the writs and to ask pleaders to state “facts.” This result was achieved by “the Field Codes,” legislation adopted in many states under the inspiration of David Dudley Field, an influential mid-century lawyer. These Codes directed pleaders to state “facts constituting a cause of action.” One of the <span title="381" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-381">p. 381</span>hopes was that the facts thus recited would enable courts to distinguish early on between strong and weak cases. What could possibly go wrong? Plenty, it turned out. Most saliently for our purposes, courts could not agree what a “fact” was. Some complaints failed because the pleaders recounted excessive detail, each event that might be relevant; courts dismissed these complaints because they contained “mere evidence.” Other complaints failed because they erred in the opposite direction, reciting their allegations at a level of generality condemned as “legal conclusions.”</p>

Abandoning the effort to do this at the pleading stage (except for the rare complaint whose allegations failed to state a claim for relief—with which a 12(b)(6) motion would deal), the Rules put the sorting function in the next stage of litigation. In the discovery phase, the thinking went, the plaintiff would dismiss or quickly settle cases with no factual foundation, or would succumb when defendant moved for summary judgment. Under this approach, the basic requirements for complaints could be quite simple:</p>

The Rule requires only a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” The drafters and subsequent revisers of the Rules appear to have assumed that the details of the claim would be unearthed in discovery and sorted out at summary judgment or trial. To better understand this long-held view about the limited role of pleadings as an obstacle, read or re-read <i>Bell v. Novick Transfer Co.</i> at page 19. The court in that case held that the plaintiff’s complaint did not need to allege more than that the car he was riding in was struck by a car owned by Defendants, and that it was operated “in a careless, reckless and negligent manner. . . . so that” the plaintiff was injured. The court refused to dismiss the complaint for failing to allege defendants’ negligence with specificity, reasoning that the details of the claim could be learned during discovery.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0b6dd07-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice that the brevity and conclusory nature of complaints under the Rules will sometimes leave the defendant largely in the dark about the details of plaintiff’s case. In <i>Bell</i>, the defendant surely wanted to know what kind of negligence the plaintiff was asserting: Did he run a light, fail to stop, have faulty brakes? Did plaintiff think he was drunk, not wearing the glasses required by his driver’s license, or something else? The complaint did not say, and the decision did not require him to say.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b6dd08-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This brevity can also benefit plaintiffs. Plaintiffs may be happy to tell their story in all its gory details—if they know it. But plaintiffs may not know all the facts at the start of the suit, or they may not be sure which version of the story they want to try to prove, and, of course, some of the “facts” they allege may turn out not to be true. Plaintiff will not know, before discovery, whether the defendant acted negligently because he had faulty brakes or was drunk. Accordingly, plaintiffs will sometimes favor briefer, sketchier recitations of the facts.</p></li>

<p id="c0b6dd0d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The corollary of the choice expressed in Rule 8 and <i>Conley</i>—endorsing brief and conclusory pleadings—is that discovery, not pleading, will do the major sorting between grounded and ungrounded claims. But deferring this sorting function until discovery has costs, for litigants and for the system as a whole. Good data on the costs of discovery is hard to come by, but in some cases discovery will be a major expense. Worse, a defendant who prevails and gets plaintiff’s claim dismissed will still have to pay the costs of discovery and defense. For some plaintiffs, on the other hand, discovery represents the only tool that will uncover evidence of a defendant’s liability. The Rules’ choice of what is sometimes called “notice pleading” thus represents a fundamental decision: It opens the doors of discovery to some complaints that may not prevail, recognizing that doing so will impose costs on the defendants in such cases. For many years, the Supreme Court stood by this interpretation of Rule 8, with the entailed allocation of costs and risks. Yet, within the past 15 years, the U.S. Supreme Court has twice reconsidered this issue, in the process working what some believe to be a fundamental shift in the landscape of modern litigation.</p>
<p id="c0b6dd0e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first step came in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007). <i>Twombly</i> represents one kind of case in which a complaint that turns out to be factually ungrounded will be expensive and time-consuming: an antitrust action. The federal antitrust laws forbid price fixing. So, if five widget manufacturers meet in a hotel room and decide they will all charge $5 per widget, they have thereby subjected themselves both to criminal penalties and civil liability. What, though, if they do not meet but just keep an eye on each other’s prices (as all business competitors do), and all, without any overt agreement, hit on $5 as the right price? As the Supreme Court has interpreted the antitrust statutes, such a situation, which antitrust lawyers call “parallel conduct,” does not create liability. But, of course, because those <span title="384" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-384">p. 384</span>who have made unlawful agreements want to keep them secret, one can sometimes infer conspiracy from parallel conduct <i>plus</i> some other circumstances. (In antitrust jargon, this is termed “parallelism plus.") To make things harder, the courts have held that conclusory allegations of a conspiracy do not suffice; the plaintiff must allege some facts leading to the inference of an unlawful agreement. The problem is that the fact of parallel behavior could be either evidence leading to an inference of conspiracy <i>or</i> innocent “parallelism.” And many thousands of hours of discovery may be necessary to find out which of these scenarios is closer to the truth.</p>
<p id="c0b7031f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Twombly</i>, the Supreme Court said that it was going to head the complaint off at the pass. In so doing it re-interpreted <i>Conley v. Gibson</i>:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0b70320-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In applying the[] general standards [of Rule 8] to a[n antitrust] claim, we hold that stating such a claim requires a complaint with enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b70321-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We alluded to the practical significance of the Rule 8 entitlement requirement in Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, when we explained that something beyond the mere possibility of loss causation must be alleged, lest a plaintiff with “’a largely groundless claim’” be allowed to “’take up the time of a number of other people, with the right to do so representing an <i>in terrorem</i> increment of the settlement value.’”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0b70322-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, it is one thing to be cautious before dismissing an antitrust complaint in advance of discovery, but quite another to forget that proceeding to antitrust discovery can be expensive. As we indicated over 20 years ago in Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 528 n.17 (1983), “a district court must retain the power to insist upon some specificity in pleading before allowing a potentially massive factual controversy to proceed.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0b70323-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs do not, of course, dispute the requirement of plausibility and the need for something more than merely parallel behavior. . . . , and their main argument against the plausibility standard at the pleading stage is its ostensible conflict with an early statement of ours construing Rule 8. Justice Black’s opinion for the Court in <i>Conley v. Gibson</i> spoke not only of the need for fair notice of the grounds for entitlement to relief but of “the accepted rule that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.” This “no set of facts” language can be read in isolation as saying that any statement revealing the theory of the claim will suffice unless its factual impossibility may be shown from the face of the pleadings; and the Court of Appeals appears to have read <i>Conley</i> in some such way when formulating its understanding of the proper pleading standard. . . . It seems fair to say that this approach to pleading would dispense with any showing of a “reasonably founded hope” that a plaintiff would be able to make a case; Mr. Micawber’s optimism would be enough.</p>
<p id="c0b70324-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Seeing this, a good many judges and commentators have balked at taking the literal terms of the <i>Conley</i> passage as a pleading standard. [The Court then cites several cases holding this view.]</p>
<p id="c0b70325-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We could go on, but there is no need to pile up further citations to show that <i>Conley</i>’s “no set of facts” language has been questioned, criticized, and explained away long enough. To be fair to the <i>Conley</i> Court, the passage should be understood in light of the opinion’s preceding summary of the complaint’s concrete allegations, which the <span title="385" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-385">p. 385</span>Court quite reasonably understood as amply stating a claim for relief. But the passage so often quoted fails to mention this understanding on the part of the Court, and after puzzling the profession for 50 years, this famous observation has earned its retirement. The phrase is best forgotten as an incomplete, negative gloss on an accepted pleading standard: once a claim has been stated adequately, it may be supported by showing any set of facts consistent with the allegations in the complaint. <i>Conley</i>, then, described the breadth of opportunity to prove what an adequate complaint claims, not the minimum standard of adequate pleading to govern a complaint’s survival. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b70326-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e do not require heightened fact pleading of specifics, but only enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. Because the plaintiffs here have not nudged their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible, their complaint must be dismissed. . . . </p>
</div>
<p id="c0b70327-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After <i>Twombly</i>, practitioners and academics debated whether one should understand the case as applying only to antitrust claims (or perhaps to other claims where immense discovery lay ahead if the complaint survived). On that interpretation pleading principles for the rest of the landscape would remain undisturbed. Two years after <i>Twombly</i>, the Supreme Court resolved that question in the next case.</p>
<p id="c0b70328-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some substantive law background may help readers understand. Well-established law states that a person has a claim against a government official who violates his constitutional rights. Well-established law also provides protection for such officials if those constitutional rights were not clearly established, in which case they enjoy a “qualified immunity” from being sued. If qualified immunity applies, the defendant official is entitled not only to prevail in litigation but to be freed from the burdens of discovery as well. And a denial of a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds is one of those rare non-dispositive decisions subject to interlocutory appeal. The next case, which has its origins in the September 11, 2001 attack on New York’s World Trade Center, looked as if it would be another case working out the meaning of qualified immunity—until it suddenly turned into a pleading case instead.</p>

In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks he was arrested in the United States on criminal charges and detained by federal officials. Respondent claims he was deprived of various constitutional protections while in federal custody. To redress the alleged deprivations, respondent filed a complaint against numerous federal officials, including John Ashcroft, the former Attorney General of the United States, and Robert Mueller, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Ashcroft and Mueller are the petitioners in the case now before us. As to these two <span title="386" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-386">p. 386</span>petitioners, the complaint alleges that they adopted an unconstitutional policy that subjected respondent to harsh conditions of confinement on account of his race, religion, or national origin.</p>

The District Court denied the motion to dismiss, concluding the complaint was sufficient to state a claim despite petitioners’ official status at the times in question. Petitioners brought an interlocutory appeal in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit[, which] affirmed the District Court’s decision.</p>
<p id="c0b70330-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent’s account of his prison ordeal could, if proved, demonstrate unconstitutional misconduct by some governmental actors. But the allegations and pleadings with respect to these actors are not before us here.

The FBI dedicated more than 4,000 special agents and 3,000 support personnel to the endeavor. By September 18 “the FBI had received more than 96,000 tips or potential leads from the public.”</p>
<p id="c0b70333-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the ensuing months the FBI questioned more than 1,000 people with suspected links to the attacks in particular or to terrorism in general. Of those individuals, some 762 were held on immigration charges; and a 184-member subset of that group was deemed to be “of ’high interest’” to the investigation. The high-interest detainees were held under restrictive conditions designed to prevent them from communicating with the general prison population or the outside world.</p>
<p id="c0b72a44-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent was one of the detainees. According to his complaint, in November 2001 agents of the FBI and Immigration and Naturalization Service arrested him on charges of fraud in relation to identification documents and conspiracy to defraud the United States. Pending trial for those crimes, respondent was housed at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, New York. Respondent was designated a person “of high interest” to the September 11 investigation and in January 2002 was placed in a section of the MDC known as the Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit (ADMAX SHU). As the facility’s name indicates, the ADMAX SHU incorporates the maximum security conditions allowable under Federal Bureau of Prison regulations. ADMAX SHU detainees were kept in lockdown 23 hours a day, spending the remaining hour outside their cells in handcuffs and leg irons accompanied by a four-officer escort.</p>

The complaint alleges that “the [FBI], under the direction of Defendant Mueller, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men. . . . as part of its investigation of the events of September 11.” It further alleges that “[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were ’cleared’ by the FBI was approved by Defendants Ashcroft and Mueller in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.” Lastly, the complaint posits that petitioners “each knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject” respondent to harsh conditions of confinement “as a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.” The pleading names Ashcroft as the “principal architect” of the policy, and identifies Mueller as “instrumental in [its] adoption, promulgation, and implementation.”</p>
<p id="c0b72a48-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state sufficient allegations to show their own involvement in clearly established unconstitutional conduct.

Accepting all of the allegations in respondent’s complaint as true, the court held that “it cannot be said that there [is] no set of facts on which [respondent] would be entitled to relief as against” petitioners [quoting the lower court opinion, which had in turn relied on <i>Conley v. Gibson</i>]. . . . While [this] appeal was pending, this Court decided <i>Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

<p id="c0b72a4e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn to respondent’s complaint. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a pleading must contain a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” As the Court held in <i>Twombly</i>, the pleading standard Rule 8 announces does not require “detailed factual allegations,” but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation. A pleading that offers “labels and conclusions” or “a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders “naked assertion[s]” devoid of “further factual enhancement.”</p>
<p id="c0b72a4f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. The plausibility standard is not akin to a “probability requirement,” but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that are “merely consistent with” a defendant’s liability, it “stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of ‘entitlement to relief.’”</p>
<p id="c0b72a50-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two working principles underlie our decision in <i>Twombly.</i> First, the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice. Rule 8 marks a notable and generous departure from the hyper-technical, code-pleading regime of a prior era, but it does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions. Second, only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss. Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will, as the Court of Appeals observed, be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. But where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not “show[n]"—"that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2).</p>
<p id="c0b72a51-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In keeping with these principles a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth. While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations. When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.</p>
<p id="c0b72a52-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="389" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-389">p. 389</span>Our decision in <i>Twombly</i> illustrates the two-pronged approach. There, we considered the sufficiency of a complaint alleging that incumbent telecommunications providers had entered an agreement not to compete and to forestall competitive entry, in violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §1. Recognizing that §1 enjoins only anticompetitive conduct “effected by a contract, combination, or conspiracy,” the plaintiffs in <i>Twombly</i> flatly pleaded that the defendants “ha[d] entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry. . . . and ha[d] agreed not to compete with one another.” The complaint also alleged that the defendants’ “parallel course of conduct. . . . to prevent competition” and inflate prices was indicative of the unlawful agreement alleged.</p>
<p id="c0b72a53-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court held the plaintiffs’ complaint deficient under Rule 8. In doing so it first noted that the plaintiffs’ assertion of an unlawful agreement was a “’legal conclusion’” and, as such, was not entitled to the assumption of truth. Had the Court simply credited the allegation of a conspiracy, the plaintiffs would have stated a claim for relief and been entitled to proceed perforce. The Court next addressed the “nub” of the plaintiffs’ complaint—the well-pleaded, nonconclusory factual allegation of parallel behavior—to determine whether it gave rise to a “plausible suggestion of conspiracy.” Acknowledging that parallel conduct was consistent with an unlawful agreement, the Court nevertheless concluded that it did not plausibly suggest an illicit accord because it was not only compatible with, but indeed was more likely explained by, lawful, unchoreographed free-market behavior. Because the well-pleaded fact of parallel conduct, accepted as true, did not plausibly suggest an unlawful agreement, the Court held the plaintiffs’ complaint must be dismissed.</p>

<p id="c0b72a55-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under <i>Twombly</i>’s construction of Rule 8, we conclude that respondent’s complaint has not “nudged [his] claims” of invidious discrimination “across the line from conceivable to plausible.”</p>
<p id="c0b72a56-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We begin our analysis by identifying the allegations in the complaint that are not entitled to the assumption of truth. Respondent pleads that petitioners “knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject [him]” to harsh conditions of confinement “as a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.” The complaint alleges that Ashcroft was the “principal architect” of this invidious policy, and that Mueller was “instrumental” in adopting and executing it. These bare assertions, much like the pleading of conspiracy in <i>Twombly</i>, amount to nothing more than a “formulaic recitation of the elements” of a constitutional discrimination claim, namely, that petitioners adopted a policy “’because of,’ not merely ’in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.” As such, the allegations are conclusory and not entitled to be assumed true. To be clear, we do not reject these bald allegations on the ground that they are unrealistic or nonsensical. We do not so characterize them any more than the Court in <i>Twombly</i> rejected the plaintiffs’ express allegation of a “’contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry,’” because it thought that claim too chimerical to be maintained. It is the conclusory nature of respondent’s allegations, rather than their extravagantly fanciful nature, that disentitles them to the presumption of truth.</p>

The complaint alleges that “the [FBI], under the direction of Defendant Mueller, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men. . . . as part of its investigation of the events of September 11.” It further claims that “[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were ’cleared’ by the FBI was approved by Defendants Ashcroft and Mueller in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.” Taken as true, these allegations are consistent with petitioners’ purposefully designating detainees “of high interest” because of their race, religion, or national origin. But given more likely explanations, they do not plausibly establish this purpose.</p>
<p id="c0b75168-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The September 11 attacks were perpetrated by 19 Arab Muslim hijackers who counted themselves members in good standing of al Qaeda, an Islamic fundamentalist group. Al Qaeda was headed by another Arab Muslim—Osama bin Laden—and composed in large part of his Arab Muslim disciples. It should come as no surprise that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though the purpose of the policy was to target neither Arabs nor Muslims. On the facts respondent alleges the arrests Mueller oversaw were likely lawful and justified by his nondiscriminatory intent to detain aliens who were illegally present in the United States and who had potential connections to those who committed terrorist acts. As between that “obvious alternative explanation” for the arrests, <i>Twombly,</i> and the purposeful, invidious discrimination respondent asks us to infer, discrimination is not a plausible conclusion.</p>
<p id="c0b75169-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But even if the complaint’s well-pleaded facts give rise to a plausible inference that respondent’s arrest was the result of unconstitutional discrimination, that inference alone would not entitle respondent to relief. It is important to recall that respondent’s complaint challenges neither the constitutionality of his arrest nor his initial detention in the MDC. Respondent’s constitutional claims against petitioners rest solely on their ostensible “policy of holding post-September-11th detainees” in the ADMAX SHU once they were categorized as “of high interest.” To prevail on that theory, the complaint must contain facts plausibly showing that petitioners purposefully adopted a policy of classifying post-September-11 detainees as “of high interest” because of their race, religion, or national origin.</p>
<p id="c0b7516a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This the complaint fails to do. Though respondent alleges that various other defendants, who are not before us, may have labeled him a person of “of high interest” for impermissible reasons, his only factual allegation against petitioners accuses them of adopting a policy approving “restrictive conditions of confinement” for post-September-11 detainees until they were “’cleared’ by the FBI.” Accepting the truth of that allegation, the complaint does not show, or even intimate, that petitioners purposefully housed detainees in the ADMAX SHU due to their race, religion, or national origin. All it plausibly suggests is that the Nation’s top law enforcement officers, in the aftermath of a devastating terrorist attack, sought to keep suspected terrorists in the most secure conditions available until the suspects could be cleared of terrorist activity. Respondent does not argue, nor can he, that such a motive would violate petitioners’ constitutional obligations. He would need to allege more by way <span title="391" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-391">p. 391</span>of factual content to “nudg[e]” his claim of purposeful discrimination “across the line from conceivable to plausible.” <i>Twombly</i>.</p>
<p id="c0b7516b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is important to note, however, that we express no opinion concerning the sufficiency of respondent’s complaint against the defendants who are not before us. Respondent’s account of his prison ordeal alleges serious official misconduct that we need not address here. Our decision is limited to the determination that respondent’s complaint does not entitle him to relief from petitioners.</p>

This argument is not supported by <i>Twombly</i> and is incompatible with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Though <i>Twombly</i> determined the sufficiency of a complaint sounding in antitrust, the decision was based on our interpretation and application of Rule 8. That Rule in turn governs the pleading standard “in all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1. Our decision in <i>Twombly</i> expounded the pleading standard for “all civil actions,” and it applies to antitrust and discrimination suits alike.</p>

<p id="c0b75171-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent next implies that our construction of Rule 8 should be tempered where, as here, the Court of Appeals has “instructed the district court to cabin discovery in such a way as to preserve” petitioners’ defense of qualified immunity “as much as possible in anticipation of a summary judgment motion.” We have held, however, that the question presented by a motion to dismiss a complaint for insufficient pleadings does not turn on the controls placed upon the discovery process. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b75172-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our rejection of the careful-case-management approach is especially important in suits where Government-official defendants are entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity. The basic thrust of the qualified-immunity doctrine is to free officials from the concerns of litigation, including “avoidance of disruptive discovery.” There are serious and legitimate reasons for this. If a Government official is to devote time to his or her duties, and to the formulation of sound and responsible policies, it is counterproductive to require the substantial diversion that is attendant to participating in litigation and making informed decisions as to how it should proceed. Litigation, though necessary to ensure that officials comply with the law, exacts heavy costs in terms of efficiency and expenditure of valuable time and resources that might otherwise be directed to the proper execution of the work of the Government. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b75173-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is no answer to these concerns to say that discovery for petitioners can be deferred while pretrial proceedings continue for other defendants.

<p id="c0b75176-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent finally maintains that the Federal Rules expressly allow him to allege petitioners’ discriminatory intent “generally,” which he equates with a conclusory allegation (citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 9). It follows, respondent says, that his complaint is sufficiently well pleaded because it claims that petitioners discriminated against him “on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.” Were we required to accept this allegation as true, respondent’s complaint would survive petitioners’ motion to dismiss. But the Federal Rules do not require courts to credit a complaint’s conclusory statements without reference to its factual context.</p>
<p id="c0b75177-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true that Rule 9(b) requires particularity when pleading “fraud or mistake,” while allowing “[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person’s mind [to] be alleged generally.” But “generally” is a relative term. In the context of Rule 9, it is to be compared to the particularity requirement applicable to fraud or mistake. Rule 9 merely excuses a party from pleading discriminatory intent under an elevated pleading standard. It does not give him license to evade the less rigid—though still operative—strictures of Rule 8. . . . </p>

Actually, the complaint goes further in alleging that Ashcroft and Muller affirmatively acted to create the discriminatory detention policy. If these factual allegations are true, Ashcroft and Mueller were, at the very least, aware of the discriminatory policy being implemented and deliberately indifferent to it.</p>
<p id="c0b7788f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ashcroft and Mueller argue that these allegations fail to satisfy the “plausibility standard” of <i>Twombly</i>. They contend that Iqbal’s claims are implausible because such high-ranking officials “tend not to be personally involved in the specific actions of lower-level officers down the bureaucratic chain of command.” But this response bespeaks a fundamental misunderstanding of the enquiry that <i>Twombly</i> demands. <i>Twombly</i> does not require a court at the motion-to-dismiss stage to consider whether the factual allegations are probably true. We made it clear, on the contrary, that a court must take the allegations as true, no matter how skeptical the court may be. The sole exception to this rule lies with allegations that are sufficiently fantastic to defy reality as we know it: claims about little green men, or the plaintiff’s recent trip to Pluto, or experiences in time travel. That is not what we have here. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b77890-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I do not understand the majority to disagree with this understanding of “plausibility” under <i>Twombly</i>. Rather, the majority discards the allegations discussed above with regard to Ashcroft and Mueller as conclusory, and is left considering only two statements in the complaint: that “the [FBI], under the direction of Defendant Mueller, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men. . . . as part of its investigation of the events of September 11,” and that “[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were ’cleared’ by the FBI was approved by Defendants Ashcroft and Mueller in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.” I think the majority is right in saying that these allegations suggest only that Ashcroft and Mueller “sought to keep suspected terrorists in the most secure conditions available until the suspects could be cleared of terrorist activity,” and that this produced “a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims.” And I agree that the two allegations selected by the majority, standing alone, do not state a plausible entitlement to relief for unconstitutional discrimination.</p>
<p id="c0b77891-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But these allegations do not stand alone as the only significant, nonconclusory statements in the complaint, for the complaint contains many allegations linking Ashcroft and Mueller to the discriminatory practices of their subordinates. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b77892-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Viewed in light of these subsidiary allegations, the allegations singled out by the majority as “conclusory” are no such thing. Iqbal’s claim is not that Ashcroft and Mueller “knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject” him to <span title="394" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-394">p. 394</span>a discriminatory practice that is left undefined; his allegation is that “they knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject” him to a particular, discrete, discriminatory policy detailed in the complaint. Iqbal does not say merely that Ashcroft was the architect of some amorphous discrimination, or that Mueller was instrumental in an ill-defined constitutional violation; he alleges that they helped to create the discriminatory policy he has described. Taking the complaint as a whole, it gives Ashcroft and Mueller “’fair notice of what the. . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.’” . . . </p>

<p id="c0b77895-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with Justice Souter and join his dissent. I write separately to point out that, like the Court, I believe it important to prevent unwarranted litigation from interfering with “the proper execution of the work of the Government.” But I cannot find in that need adequate justification for the Court’s interpretation of <i>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly</i> and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. The law, after all, provides trial courts with other legal weapons designed to prevent unwarranted interference. As the Second Circuit explained, where a Government defendant asserts a qualified immunity defense, a trial court, responsible for managing a case and “mindful of the need to vindicate the purpose of the qualified immunity defense,” can structure discovery in ways that diminish the risk of imposing unwarranted burdens upon public officials. A district court, for example, can begin discovery with lower level government defendants before determining whether a case can be made to allow discovery related to higher level government officials. Neither the briefs nor the Court’s opinion provides convincing grounds for finding these alternative case-management tools inadequate, either in general or in the case before us. For this reason, as well as for the independently sufficient reasons set forth in Justice Souter’s opinion, I would affirm the Second Circuit.</p>

The Civil Rules Advisory Committee could have entertained a proposal that would amend either Rule 8 or Rule 12 to provide for the two-step ignore-conclusory-allegations-then-decide-about-plausibility screening process. No such proposal has come to them. Had there been such a suggestion, the proposed Rule would have been subject to extensive comment by the bar and by the academy, and perhaps to some empirical studies designed to assess the nature and dimensions of the underlying problem. That did not occur except incidentally in the <i>Iqbal</i> briefs. Commentators have argued that the Justices should have been more hesitant to reinterpret the civil rules given the available amendment process. Justice Stevens, dissenting in <i>Twombly,</i> apparently thought so as well. He wrote: “I would not rewrite the Nation’s civil procedure textbooks and call into doubt the pleading rules of most of its States without far more informed deliberation as to the costs of doing so. Congress has established a process—a rulemaking process—for revisions of that order.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b79fb4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What does <i>Iqbal</i> mean in practice?</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0b79fb5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Commentators have been trying to answer this question since the opinion was announced in 2009, and have disagreed both regarding the answer and the proper methodology to apply. Some have compared courts’ motion to dismiss grant rates before and after <i>Twombly</i> and <i>Iqbal</i> were decided. Yet, as several scholars have observed, such studies do not take into account the likelihood that litigants’ behaviors might change as well: <span title="396" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-396">p. 396</span>Some plaintiffs may decide not to file a lawsuit knowing that it cannot withstand a plausibility pleading challenge, or might settle a case soon after filing for fear of a successful motion to dismiss. By the same token, after <i>Twombly</i> and <i>Iqbal</i>, defendants might be more likely to file a motion to dismiss, believing that the new standard increases their chances of success. Jonah Gelbach, attempting to capture both judicial and litigant effects, found that “[f]or employment discrimination and civil rights cases, switching from <i>Conley</i> to <i>Twombly/Iqbal</i> negatively affected plaintiffs in at least 15.4% [of employment] and at least 18.1% of [civil rights] cases. . . . that faced [motions to dismiss] in the <i>Iqbal</i> period. Among cases not involving civil rights, employment discrimination, or financial instruments, <i>Twombly/Iqbal</i> negatively affected at least 21.5% of plaintiffs facing [such motions] in the <i>Iqbal</i> study period.” Jonah B. Gelbach, <i>Locking the Doors to Discovery? Assessing the Effects of</i> Twombly <i>and</i> Iqbal <i>on Access to Discovery,</i> 121 Yale L.J. 2270, 2277-78 (2012). Others argue that pleading should not change dramatically post <i>Iqbal</i> because plaintiffs have strong incentives, regardless of pleading rules, to investigate the factual basis for their claims before filing and include those facts in their complaints. See William H.J. Hubbard, <i>A Fresh Look at Plausibility Pleading</i>, 83 U. Chi. L. Rev. 693 (2016). Scholars, using a variety of data and a variety of methodologies, have reached wide-ranging results. In 2013, David Engstrom counted 20 studies measuring <i>Twiqbal</i>’s impact.

<li class=""><p id="c0b79fb6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judges also seem unsure about what <i>Iqbal</i> means in practice. Just as Justices Kennedy and Souter appeared to disagree about which allegations in Iqbal’s complaint were conclusory, judges have not distinguished between “factual” and “conclusory” allegations in a uniform manner and have assessed “plausibility” in different ways. <i>Iqbal</i> in fact encourages this inconsistency, as it instructs judges to assess allegations in light of their “judicial experience and common sense,” factors likely to differ from judge to judge.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b79fb7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the meaning of these two cases has yet to be worked out, and because they seem to offer a powerful new tool to defendants, “the <i>Twombly-Iqbal</i> motion” has become a staple of federal civil litigation.

<p id="c0b7c6ce-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you have seen in <i>Twombly</i> and <i>Iqbal,</i> courts, rulemakers, and legislators have long wrestled with the question of how much specificity to require in pleadings. The 1938 Rules sought to avoid this problem with their “short and plain statement” requirement. But, in Rule 9, the drafters carved out some areas where a Rule requires more detail, and statutes have sometimes either required extra specificity or forbidden it. We look at a sample of such special cases.</p>

<p id="c0b7c6d4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . Dr. Stradford[, the plaintiff] is a dentist who maintains an office in Staten Island, New York. . . . Defendants are affiliated corporate insurers. Northern issued a policy of insurance. . . . on Dr. Stradford’s office effective August 18, 1999, thereby insuring the premises until August 19, 2000. During this term, Dr. Stradford apparently failed to pay the required insurance premiums, and Northern cancelled the Policy from October 10, 1999 to December 13, 1999. On or about December 6, 1999, however, Dr. Stradford submitted a “no claims” letter certifying that he had no losses from October 19, 1999, to that date. He also apparently resumed paying the premiums, and National reinstated the Policy on or about December 14, 1999. Dr. Stradford was notified of the reinstatement on or about January 9, 2000.</p>
<p id="c0b7c6d5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Less than ten days later, Dr. Stradford filed a claim on the Policy. Dr. Stradford notified Northern that, “[o]n January 17, 2000, [he] returned to his office from his vacation and found water dripping from frozen pipes and extensive water damage to his personal property and the interior of his office.” He further notified Northern <span title="398" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-398">p. 398</span>that certain dental implants, worth more than $100,000, which had apparently been stored in his office, “had become wet and [therefore] ruined.” Dr. Stradford submitted a claim under the Policy for $151,154.74, and Northern made payments to Dr. Stradford in this amount. After receiving these payments, Dr. Stradford “submitted a revised claim under the Policy totaling $1,385,456.70, consisting of $168,000.00 for property damage, and a business interruption claim of $1,209,456.70.” Northern continued to investigate Dr. Stradford’s claimed loss. [The insurer concluded that the damage had occurred during the period when the insurance had lapsed because Dr. Stratford had not paid the premium and disclaimed coverage.]</p>
<p id="c0b7c6d6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Slightly less than one year later, plaintiffs commenced this suit seeking $1,385,456.70 on the Policy, less the $151,154.74 already paid, or $1,234,301.96. Defendants counterclaimed, asserting, inter alia, that Dr. Stradford “knowingly and willfully devised a scheme and artifice. . . . to defraud defendants and obtain money by false pretenses and representations,” and seeking the return of the $151,154.74, punitive damages, and investigation expenses. Dr. Stradford now moves, inter alia, to dismiss those counterclaims that are based in fraud for failure to state their claims with sufficient “particularity” under Rule 9(b), and to dismiss certain other counterclaims for failure to state a claim.</p>
<p id="c0b7c6d7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 9(b) provides, ["In alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person’s mind may be alleged generally."]*<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1094D_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1094D_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*4</a></span> Here, defendants’ counterclaims succeed in alleging facts that “give rise to a strong inference of fraudulent intent” as required by the second sentence of Rule 9(b). The timing of Dr. Stradford’s claim, just ten days after the policy was reinstated, his alleged refusal to cooperate with National’s investigation. . . . and the size of his claim can fairly be said to satisfy this requirement.</p>
<p id="c0b7c6d9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find, however, that the counterclaims do not satisfy the first sentence of Rule 9(b), which requires that the “time, place, and nature of the [alleged] misrepresentations” be disclosed to the party accused of fraud. Ross v. Bolton, 904 F.2d 819, 823 (2d Cir. 1990). Here, defendants’ counterclaims simply fail to identify the statement made by Dr. Stradford that they claim to be false. Thus, it is unclear from the face of the counterclaims whether defendants assert that Dr. Stradford’s claimed losses are improperly inflated, that Dr. Stradford’s office never even flooded, or that the offices flooded, but not during the term of the Policy. In essence, defendants claim that Dr. Stradford lied, but fail to identify the lie.</p>
<p id="c0b7c6da-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “primary purpose” of Rule 9(b) is to afford a litigant accused of fraud “fair notice of the[] claim and the factual ground upon which it is based.” Here, defendants’ counterclaims fail to provide Dr. Stradford with fair notice of precisely which statement, or which aspect of his claim on the Policy, they allege to be false. The counterclaims are therefore insufficient under Rule 9(b), and must be dismissed.</p>

Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) ("leave [to amend] shall be freely given when justice so requires"). Indeed, defendants have already moved for leave to amend and submitted a proposed amended pleading. This pleading cures the defects we found in the counterclaims dismissed above because it makes clear that defendants allege that Dr. Stradford’s office was flooded at a time when he permitted the Policy to lapse, and that Dr. Stradford “misrepresented the date of the loss in an effort to bring the date of loss within the coverage period.” Accordingly, we hereby grant defendants leave to amend their counterclaims. . . . </p>

<p id="c0b7edf2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case did not start as a fraud claim. How and why did fraud come into the picture? The policy and the claims forms contained clauses requiring Dr. Stradford to be truthful in his dealings with the insurer. If he had been untruthful, the insurer would have a defense to the plaintiff’s breach of contract claims and could recapture any money already paid out. So why did the insurer allege fraud? Those of you who have read Chapter 5 know that punitive damages are available for fraud but not for breach of contract. Although punitive damages are awarded relatively rarely, the possibility that they might be imposed could strengthen the insurer’s hand during settlement negotiations.</p>
<p id="c0b7edf3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider an alternative explanation. Disputes like this one will be presented at least to a judge, and perhaps to a jury as well. No one likes an insurance company <span title="400" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-400">p. 400</span>that collects premiums but then fails to pay claims. By turning this case into one about fraud, the insurer can present itself—not Dr. Stradford—as the aggrieved party, the victim of fraud.</p>
<p id="c0b7edf4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Stradford, the plaintiff, won the first skirmish in the pleading battle, when the court ruled that the insurer defendant had failed to plead fraud with the specificity required by Rule 9. But that victory proved very short-lived, as one can see in the closing sentences of the opinion: The court grants leave to amend and grants the insurer leave to seek summary judgment on plaintiff’s original breach of contract claim—when the court granted defendant’s summary judgment motion three months later, it left only the fraud claim against Dr. Stradford to be adjudicated.</p>

<p id="c0b7edfb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Taking into consideration all of the allegations in Lanco’s answer, defendant nonetheless failed to plead specific facts regarding the fraud such as the identity of Sheraton’s agents or employees making the fraudulent representations, the identity of Lanco agents to whom the statements were made, the dates or locations of meetings between the parties, or the exchange of any documents during negotiations. The alleged misrepresentations themselves also are vague and fail to specify the obligations that Sheraton agreed to undertake. Courts have dismissed fraud claims pursuant to Rule 9(b) even where the pleader alleged specific communications because the claims lacked “particularized facts to support the inference that [a party] acted. . . . with fraudulent intent.” <i>Shields</i>, 25 F.3d at 1128-29 (party cited press releases and publicly filed corporate documents to establish fraudulent statements or nondisclosures).

Supp. 512, 526-27 n.20 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (holding that plaintiff satisfied Rule 9(b) because party deposition supplemented pleadings to establish time and place of meeting and people who were present). The affidavit that Lanco submitted in connection with this motion provides no additional information regarding the alleged fraud. Moreover, Lanco’s general allegation that Sheraton “knew the representations made were false, fraudulent and made with the intent to defraud” is insufficient pleading of scienter.

<li class=""><p id="c0b7edfd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why does Rule 9(b) require more specificity in pleading?</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0b7edfe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the fraud plaintiff the problem is that, if fraud occurred, plaintiff is likely still to be in the dark about some of the salient facts. In the actual case, Northern Insurance was able to get some prefiling “discovery” from Dr. Stradford under the terms of the insurance policy. In most fraud cases that won’t be true. In those “average” cases the fraud plaintiff’s lawyer wants to get to discovery to uncover information proving that defendant was misrepresenting the facts. But discovery will be unavailable if the complaint is dismissed for failure to plead with sufficient specificity to comply with Rule 9(b).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b7edff-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the defendant and the legal system the problem is that fraud and mistake cases threaten the legal framework of contract.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcroman">
<li class=""><p id="c0b7ee00-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like contract, fraud grows from some dealing between the parties but has consequences quite different from contract. The point emerges perhaps most clearly in cases in which a “contract” plaintiff alleges that the defendant committed fraud because, even “during the negotiation and formation of the contract. . . . defendants materially misrepresented facts so as to induce plaintiff. . . . to pay for said goods when defendants had no intention of delivering the goods as promised.” Event Marketing Concepts, Inc. v. East Coast Logo, Inc., 1998 WL 414657, *2 (E.D. Pa. 1998). Contract disputes can thus easily turn into claims of fraud, exposing the defendant to punitive damages, thwarting the rule of expectation damages typical of contract claims.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b7ee01-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mistake has similar but less dramatic consequences. A valid claim of mistake regarding the terms of an agreement will void a contract. But one of the bedrock ideas of contract is to settle, in advance, the consequences of some kinds of “mistake.” If it is easy to plead mistake, a basic institution of current economic life—contract—is weakened.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0b7ee02-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Rule 9(b) is the only federal Rule requiring such specificity, there are other state and federal laws that have adopted special pleading requirements for certain claims.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0b7ee03-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, California Code of Civil Procedure §425.13(a) provides that no complaint may state a claim for punitive damages against a health care provider “unless the court enters an order allowing an amended pleading,” and that the court may enter such an order only after “supporting and opposing affidavits [show] that the plaintiff has established that there is a substantial <span title="402" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-402">p. 402</span>probability that the plaintiff will prevail.  . . . ” Like Rule 9(b), California’s procedure seeks to prevent insubstantial claims from advancing to discovery, but through different means. Is the California approach (amend after presenting evidence) preferable to the federal approach (plead specifically)?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b7ee04-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In one specialized area involving fraud—securities—Congress has gone well beyond the requirements of Rule 9(b). The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 sets forth elaborate pleading requirements that apply only to claims alleging fraud under federal securities statutes. Two of those requirements go beyond Rule 9(b). One provides that the complaint “shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.” 15 U.S.C. §78u-4(b)(1)(B). The same statute replaces the relative leniency of Rule 9(b) regarding states of mind, requiring instead that a plaintiff “state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.” 15 U.S.C. §78u-4(b)(2).</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0b81515-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So far we have examined instances in which courts or statutes have required “extra” specificity. In some areas, courts, legislatures, and drafters of Rules have gone in the other direction, either forbidding specificity or making clear that it was not required. Responding to reports in which defendants fainted or had cardiac episodes after reading the amount of damages demanded in personal injury and wrongful death complaints, the California legislature has forbidden a plaintiff seeking damages in such cases from stating any specific amount in the initial complaint, instead allowing the defendant, after receiving the complaint, to demand a statement of damages.

<p id="c0b81518-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have considered how pleading helps to define substantive law and, on occasion, aspires to sort strong from weak claims. But we’re still missing an important piece of the picture. The substantive law tells the parties in general what issues matter in the lawsuit. The rules of pleading tell the parties the level of detail required.</p>
<p id="c0b81519-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But in a system driven by party initiative, one must also ask which party has the responsibility for alleging and, ultimately, proving which of those issues. To take a simple example, suppose in a claim for negligently inflicted injuries, the plaintiff alleged an accident, that the accident caused her injuries, and the extent of those injuries; would that complaint stand? You are likely to respond intuitively—no, the plaintiff has failed to allege defendant’s negligence. But why is that plaintiff’s job; why isn’t it defendant’s job, in his answer, to allege the absence of negligence? After all, we do not require plaintiff to allege that the statute of limitations has not expired; if defendant so claims, it is his job to allege that in the answer. Why? To take an actual example, why couldn’t Joseph Haddle just allege that he was fired, and leave it to the defendant to prove that the firing was justified? Putting this <span title="403" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-403">p. 403</span>question into technical procedural terms, which elements of the claim must be part of the complaint, and which are defenses, which the defendant must plead in his answer?</p>
<p id="c0b8151a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any given case, resolving this issue can be important because, as a general rule, whichever party has the “burden” of pleading an issue must also produce evidence to demonstrate that allegation—or lose the case. If the case is close or the evidence bearing on the element in question difficult to locate, the locating of the burden may determine the outcome of the case. So how does a pleader know which party has the burden of pleading which element? For the great majority of common claims (like the example of negligence given above), either a millennium of common law cases or the applicable statute provide answers. Rule 8(c) sets out a list of affirmative defenses that a party responding to a pleading must assert. But new claims and new twists on old claims arise regularly. The next case displays the Supreme Court confronting a new burden of pleading question that arose after Congress changed the rules for prisoners challenging their conditions of confinement.</p>

He claimed that, after he suffered injuries in custody in an automobile accident, prison staff refused to change his work assignment despite his complaints that the assignment aggravated his injuries. According to his allegations a prison staff member “told him to do the work or ’suffer the consequences.’ Jones performed the required tasks and allegedly aggravated his injuries.” Jones sued under 42 U.S.C. §1983.

<p id="c0b81522-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prisoner litigation continues to “account for an outsized share of filings” in federal district courts. In 2005, nearly 10 percent of all civil cases filed in federal courts nationwide were prisoner complaints challenging prison conditions or claiming civil rights violations. Most of these cases have no merit; many are frivolous. Our legal system, however, remains committed to guaranteeing that prisoner claims of illegal conduct by their custodians are fairly handled according to law. The challenge lies in ensuring that the flood of nonmeritorious claims does not submerge and effectively preclude consideration of the allegations with merit.</p>
<p id="c0b81523-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress addressed that challenge in the [Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. §§1997e et seq. (PLRA)]. What this country needs, Congress decided, is fewer and better prisoner suits. To that end, Congress enacted a variety of reforms designed to filter out the bad claims and facilitate consideration of the good. Key among these <span title="404" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-404">p. 404</span>was the requirement that inmates complaining about prison conditions exhaust prison grievance remedies before initiating a lawsuit.</p>
<p id="c0b81524-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The exhaustion provision of the PLRA states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0b81525-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under [42 U.S.C. §1983], or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0b81526-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Requiring exhaustion allows prison officials an opportunity to resolve disputes concerning the exercise of their responsibilities before being haled into court. This has the potential to reduce the number of inmate suits, and also to improve the quality of suits that are filed by producing a useful administrative record. In an attempt to implement the exhaustion requirement, some lower courts have imposed procedural rules that have become the subject of varying levels of disagreement among the federal courts of appeals.</p>
<p id="c0b81527-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first question presented centers on a conflict over whether exhaustion under the PLRA is a pleading requirement the prisoner must satisfy in his complaint or an affirmative defense the defendant must plead and prove. . . . </p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0b81528-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">II</p></div>
<p id="c0b81529-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and that unexhausted claims cannot be brought in court. What is less clear is whether it falls to the prisoner to plead and demonstrate exhaustion in the complaint, or to the defendant to raise lack of exhaustion as an affirmative defense. The minority rule, adopted by the Sixth Circuit, places the burden of pleading exhaustion in a case covered by the PLRA on the prisoner; most courts view failure to exhaust as an affirmative defense.</p>
<p id="c0b8152a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think petitioners, and the majority of courts to consider the question, have the better of the argument. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires simply a “short and plain statement of the claim” in a complaint, while Rule 8(c) identifies a nonexhaustive list of affirmative defenses that must be pleaded in response. The PLRA itself is not a source of a prisoner’s claim; claims covered by the PLRA are typically brought under 42 U.S.C. §1983, which does not require exhaustion at all. Petitioners assert that courts typically regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense in other contexts, and respondents do not seriously dispute the general proposition. We have referred to exhaustion in these terms, including in the similar statutory scheme governing habeas corpus. The PLRA dealt extensively with the subject of exhaustion, but is silent on the issue whether exhaustion must be pleaded by the plaintiff or is an affirmative defense. This is strong evidence that the usual practice should be followed, and the usual practice under the Federal Rules is to regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense.</p>
<p id="c0b8152b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a series of recent cases, we have explained that courts should generally not depart from the usual practice under the Federal Rules on the basis of perceived policy concerns. Thus, in Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163 (1993), we unanimously reversed the court of appeals for imposing a heightened pleading standard in §1983 suits against municipalities. We explained that “perhaps if [the] Rules. . . . were rewritten today, claims against municipalities under §1983 might be subjected to the added specificity requirement. . . . But <span title="405" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-405">p. 405</span>that is a result which must be obtained by the process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.”</p>
<p id="c0b83c3c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506 (2002), we unanimously reversed the court of appeals for requiring employment discrimination plaintiffs to specifically allege the elements of a prima facie case of discrimination. We explained that “the Federal Rules do not contain a heightened pleading standard for employment discrimination suits,” and a “requirement of greater specificity for particular claims” must be obtained by amending the Federal Rules. And just last Term, in <i>Hill v. McDonough</i>, we unanimously rejected a proposal that §1983 suits challenging a method of execution must identify an acceptable alternative: “Specific pleading requirements are mandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and not, as a general rule, through case-by-case determinations of the federal courts.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0b83c3d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The argument that screening would be more effective if exhaustion had to be shown in the complaint proves too much; the same could be said with respect to any affirmative defense. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b83c3e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA, and that inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints. We understand the reasons behind the decisions of some lower courts to impose a pleading requirement on plaintiffs in this context, but that effort cannot fairly be viewed as an interpretation of the PLRA. . . . Given that the PLRA does not itself require plaintiffs to plead exhaustion, such a result “must be obtained by the process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0b83c3f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are not insensitive to the challenges faced by the lower federal courts in managing their dockets and attempting to separate, when it comes to prisoner suits, not so much wheat from chaff as needles from haystacks. We once again reiterate, however—as we did unanimously in <i>Leatherman</i>, <i>Swierkiewicz</i>, and <i>Hill</i>—that adopting different and more onerous pleading rules to deal with particular categories of cases should be done through established rulemaking procedures, and not on a case-by-case basis by the courts.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0b83c48-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The PLRA could have included a sentence or phrase requiring that “as a condition of maintaining suit, each plaintiff must plead exhaustion of administrative remedies, attaching to his complaint documents demonstrating compliance with this requirement.”</p></li>

</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b83c4b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why does the outcome of <i>Jones v. Bock</i> matter?</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0b83c4c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the great majority of cases the pleading rules provide a blueprint for later stages of the suit. Whoever has the burden of pleading an element of the claim will likely also have the burden of producing evidence to demonstrate that allegation. So the issue lurking behind every decision about the burden of pleading is who will ultimately have to prove the thing alleged in the pleading.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b83c4d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Occasionally, the answer to that question will not matter. If Mr. Jones has neatly filed in his prison cell a copy of every grievance he made to the prison authorities, together with their responses, it will make no difference who has the burden. He will produce the documents, and the case will proceed to the merits—did the prison authorities behave with deliberate indifference (the constitutional standard in such suits) or, as they may claim, was the plaintiff just another prisoner trying to shirk?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b83c4e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But that’s not likely to be the case here. Suppose Jones has copies of some of his grievances, but not of others. In that case, the burden of pleading may take on great significance. Trial may turn into a swearing contest between the prison staff and Jones. Jones: “I complied with the prison’s administrative grievance procedures.” Warden: “No he didn’t.” If the trier of fact is unsure who’s telling the truth the outcome may turn on who has the burden of persuasion, which usually follows the burden of pleading.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b83c4f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So, how is a court faced with such a problem to decide it, in the absence of legislative guidance? The opinion canvasses the usual sources:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0b86360-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It looks at the words of the statute. Does the Court adequately explain why the opening phrase of the statute ("No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions” [unless the prisoner has sought an administrative remedy]) does not set forth a pleading requirement? Perhaps because the claim does not arise under the newly enacted PLRA but under a venerable civil rights statute, 42 U.S.C. §1983?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b86361-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="407" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-407">p. 407</span>The Court also looks at Rule 8(c), which lists common affirmative defenses, and finds that “failure to exhaust administrative remedies” is not among them. But, the Court notes, the list in Rule 8(c) is “nonexhaustive” (is the Chief Justice engaging in word play here?); in other words, there are instances not listed in Rule 8(c) where clearly established law provides that something is an affirmative defense. Does the statute creating Jones’s claim so provide?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b86362-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To answer that question, the opinion examines the legislative history of the PLRA ("The PLRA dealt extensively with the subject of exhaustion, but is silent on the issue whether exhaustion must be pleaded by the plaintiff or is an affirmative defense.

<li class=""><p id="c0b86363-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It then concludes that the usual practice “is to regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense” and rejects policy arguments in favor of putting the burden on the prisoner.</p></li>

<p id="c0b8636b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming one knows the substantive law and the amount of detail required in a pleading, a third question emerges: What if one has several, perhaps inconsistent, stories to tell?</p>
<p id="c0b8636c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="408" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-408">p. 408</span>A common law pleader had to worry about the consistency of his complaint. If Plaintiff alleged Defendant trespassed on Blackacre, Defendant could not simultaneously deny that he had entered Blackacre and assert that he did enter but had an easement. The attractiveness of this insistence on a single consistent story is obvious: We expect people in ordinary life not to vary their version of the facts from moment to moment. A person may legitimately assert either that she made a promise or she didn’t; that she kept her promise or she didn’t; but not that she didn’t make a promise <i>and</i> that she kept it.</p>
<p id="c0b8636d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet modern pleading rules, of which Rule 8(d)(2)-(3) is one example, permit just this sort of apparent duplicity: “A party may set out two or more statements of a claim or defense alternately or hypothetically. . . . [and a] party may state as many separate claims or defenses as it has, regardless of consistency.” As a result, a defendant may deny that she ever entered into a contract with plaintiff and at the same time assert that she kept her side of the bargain; similarly, a plaintiff may seek to recover on the ground that a written contract provides “<i>X</i>” and simultaneously seek to have the court reform the contract so that the crucial clause reads “not <i>X</i>” rather than “<i>X</i>.”</p>
<p id="c0b8636e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Understanding why modern procedure condones behavior that one would condemn in everyday life requires the student to recall the role of the pleadings in the lawsuit. First, pleadings come very early in the case, often before the parties know all that they will by the time the case comes to trial or to the point of serious settlement discussions. The lawyer is therefore often setting forth what seem to her to be the possible versions of the law and the facts that appear plausible at the time the pleading is filed. If discovery reveals that one of the inconsistent stories lacks strong evidentiary support, an amended complaint will drop it. Second, allegations in pleadings are tempered by burdens of proof. Thus, a lawyer who entirely believes her client’s story that he had, but lost, a signed, written contract may allege that in her pleadings but, as a safety net, may also seek to recover on a quantum meruit count in case she decides she cannot convince a jury that the written contract existed. Finally, one has to remember that however inconsistent and contradictory the pleadings, the lawyer will often have to settle on a single version of the story before the case comes to trial. Both judge and jury will frown on a case that rests on logically inconsistent versions of the facts. (In a multiparty case the plaintiff might conceivably try different versions of the facts against different defendants, but this tactic has its limits.) Thus, inconsistent pleadings reflect not lawyers’ propensity to talk out of both sides of their mouths but a pleading system that requires lawyers to make allegations before they are certain of the facts and the law. Inconsistent pleadings represent alternative drafts of a story, one version of which the advocate hopes ultimately will persuade a judge or jury.</p>
<p id="c0b8636f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A real-life example of alternate pleading appears in ¶14 of the <i>Haddle v. Garrison</i> complaint (at page 367). It alleges both that Haddle testified before the grand jury and that he did not testify but was prepared to do so. Obviously, both of these cannot be true. Presumably, Haddle’s lawyer drafted the complaint at a stage where he was not entirely clear what happened, so he included both versions in his complaint. By the time the case reached trial, he would have decided which version to rest on.</p>

<p id="c0b86372-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have thus far examined pleading as a question of technique: how much detail; what issues are raised by a motion to dismiss; which party bears the responsibility for pleading which element of a claim; and how does modern pleading differ from its predecessors? Lawyers must understand those issues. But pleading raises another, more fundamental question: What responsibilities does the lawyer bear to her client and to the legal system? Many of those issues reach far beyond the scope of procedure, but one Rule requires us to examine these questions at the pleading stage.</p>
<p id="c0b86373-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have glimpsed one aspect of this problem in <i>Haddle</i>. Haddle’s lawyer could have avoided a 12(b)(6) dismissal by alleging that Haddle’s contract guaranteed he would not be fired except for good cause. But Haddle’s lawyer didn’t. Why?</p>
<p id="c0b86374-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without regard to ethical responsibilities, such ungrounded allegations are a waste of time and money. The case would survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion only to collapse when it became clear that the allegations had no factual basis. But there is a second dimension—an ethical dimension. Long-standing rules and codes of professional responsibility forbid a lawyer from making groundless allegations. Consider, for example, Rule 3.1 of the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct:</p>

That by itself makes it an unusual Rule of Procedure. Most of the Rules tell lawyers how to operate the system: where to file papers, how to join parties, how to plead, what counts as a pre-answer defense, how to conduct discovery, and the like. Rule 11 is different. It regulates the way lawyers and clients conduct themselves, establishing standards for investigation of law and facts. In so doing, it embodies in a procedural rule a standard that might otherwise be found in a standard of professional conduct, or in the tort of malicious prosecution.</p>
<p id="c0b88a88-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One might ask two questions about such an approach. First, one can ask whether such a principle in a Rule violates the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. §2072(b), which provides that the Rules shall not “abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.” The Supreme Court considered and somewhat curtly dismissed the Rules Enabling Act challenge:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0b88a89-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court[]. . . . in Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U.S. 1 (1987). . . . held, in a unanimous decision, that “Rules which <i>incidentally</i> affect litigants’ substantive rights <span title="410" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-410">p. 410</span>do not violate this provision if reasonably necessary to maintain the integrity of that system of rules.” There is little doubt that Rule 11 is reasonably necessary to maintain the integrity of the system of federal practice and procedure, and that any effect on substantive rights is incidental. We held as much only last Term in <i>Cooter &amp; Gell</i>: “It is now clear that the central purpose of Rule 11 is to deter baseless filings in district court and thus, consistent with the Rule Enabling Act’s grant of authority, streamline the administration and procedure of the federal courts.”</p>

<p id="c0b88a8b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, one can ask, if professional ethics already condemn such conduct, why duplicate the provision in a procedural rule? One response is that Rule 11 allows courts to enforce the standards in the midst of litigation, rather than in an independent bar disciplinary proceeding that might occur long after the lawsuit was over. That potential can change the balance of power between the parties—and this aspect of Rule 11 has made it controversial, with some arguing that it chills meritorious litigation, others that it fails to deter enough frivolous litigation.</p>
<p id="c0b88a8c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 11 is distinctive in another respect. It establishes an interlocking set of standards, procedures, and sanctions—a miniature regulatory regime all its own, a regime that affects but does not directly regulate the entire conduct of litigation.</p>
<p id="c0b88a8d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We consider Rule 11 in the context of pleading, but it covers every aspect of litigation that involves a written document—with the important exception noted in Rule 11(d). Pleading provides a good example of circumstances in which litigants make assertions about historical facts and the content of legal standards—both of which Rule 11 covers. Read the Rule and respond to the following questions.</p>

This is a burden that plaintiffs desiring to invoke diversity jurisdiction have assumed since the days of Chief Justice Marshall. See Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. at 267 [1806].

P. 11(c). “Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm [must] be held jointly responsible for violations committed by its partner[], associate[], or employee[].” Id. 11(c)(1). Monetary sanctions for violation of Rule 11(b)(2) may not be awarded against a represented party. Id. 11(c)([5])(A). Defendants’ argument that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiff’s retaliation claims was frivolous under an objective standard of reasonableness. Defendants’ argument was not a contention about subject matter jurisdiction. It was simply a contention that plaintiff would be unable to prove her claims on the merits. Arguments about the merits of plaintiff’s claims, of course, do not go to the court’s power to entertain them, and are not appropriately raised on a motion to dismiss the complaint. No competent lawyer, after reasonable inquiry, would have concluded that this argument was warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law. . . . Because defendants presented to the court a written motion asserting frivolous legal contentions, plaintiff’s motion for sanctions under Rule 11(b)(2) is granted. Moreover, I am persuaded that defendants’ motion and supporting papers were presented for an improper purpose; namely, <span title="416" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-416">p. 416</span>to harass plaintiff and to increase needlessly the cost of litigating her claims.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D6E_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10D6E_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span> Accordingly, plaintiff’s motion for sanctions under Rule 11(b)(1) is also granted. Defendants’ motion was submitted and signed by James D. Harmon, Jr. of The Harmon Firm. Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against The Harmon Firm and Mr. Harmon under Rule 11(b)(1) and (2). Sanctions are also imposed against Wilson Elser, Fuerth, and Anesh under Rule 11(b)(1) for presenting papers to the court for an improper purpose. Defendants are experienced lawyers who can fairly be held responsible for papers submitted to the court on their behalf. Moreover, defendants supported their motion with affidavits signed by the individual defendants and other agents of the defendant law firm. . . . </p>

<p id="c0b92610-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is difficult to imagine that the Barbie doll, so perfect in her sculpture and presentation, and so comfortable in every setting, from “California girl” to “Chief Executive Officer Barbie,” could spawn such acrimonious litigation and such egregious conduct on the part of her challenger. In her wildest dreams, Barbie could not have imagined herself in the middle of Rule 11 proceedings. But the intersection of copyrights on Barbie sculptures and the scope of Rule 11 is precisely what defines this case.</p>
<p id="c0b92611-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">James Hicks appeals from a district court order requiring him, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, to pay Mattel, Inc. $501,565 in attorneys’ fees that it incurred in defending against what the district court determined to be a frivolous action. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b92612-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mattel is a toy company that is perhaps best recognized as the manufacturer of the world-famous Barbie doll. Since Barbie’s creation in 1959, Mattel has outfitted her in fashions and accessories that have evolved over time. . . . Mattel has sought to protect its intellectual property by registering various Barbie-related copyrights, including copyrights protecting the doll’s head sculpture. Mattel has vigorously litigated against putative infringers.</p>
<p id="c0b92613-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="417" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-417">p. 417</span>In 1990, Claudene Christian, then an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California ("USC"), decided to create and market a collegiate cheerleader doll. The doll, which the parties refer to throughout their papers as “Claudene,” had blonde hair and blue eyes and was outfitted to resemble a USC cheerleader. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b92614-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the complaint, which Hicks signed, Christian alleged that Mattel obtained a copy of the copyrighted Claudene doll in 1996, the year of its creation,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DB9_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10DB9_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">2</a></span> and then infringed its overall appearance, including its face paint, by developing a new Barbie line called “Cool Blue” that was substantially similar to Claudene. Christian sought damages in the amount of $2.4 billion and various forms of injunctive relief. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b92616-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two months after the complaint was filed, Mattel moved for summary judgment. In support of its motion, Mattel proffered evidence that the Cool Blue Barbie doll contained a 1991 copyright notice on the back of its head, indicating that it predated Claudene’s head sculpture copyright by approximately six years. Mattel therefore argued that Cool Blue Barbie could not as a matter of law infringe Claudene’s head sculpture copyright. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b92617-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At a follow-up counsel meeting required by a local rule, Mattel’s counsel attempted to convince Hicks that his complaint was frivolous. During the videotaped meeting. . . . Hicks declined Mattel’s invitation to inspect the dolls and, later during the meeting, hurled them in disgust from a conference table.</p>
<p id="c0b92618-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having been unsuccessful in convincing Hicks to dismiss Christian’s action voluntarily, Mattel served Hicks with a motion for Rule 11 sanctions. . . . Hicks declined to withdraw the complaint during the 21-day safe harbor period provided by Rule 11, and Mattel filed its motion. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b92619-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court granted Mattel’s motions for summary judgment and Rule 11 sanctions. The court ruled that Mattel did not infringe the 1997 Claudene copyright because it could not possibly have accessed the Claudene doll at the time it created the head sculptures of the Cool Blue (copyrighted in 1991) and Virginia Tech (copyrighted in 1976) Barbies. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b9261a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As for Mattel’s Rule 11 motion, the district court found that Hicks had “filed a meritless claim against defendant Mattel. A reasonable investigation by Mr. Hicks would have revealed that there was no factual foundation for [Christian’s] copyright claim.” Indeed, the district court noted that Hicks needed to do little more than examine “the back of the heads of the Barbie dolls he claims were infringing,” because such a perfunctory inquiry would have revealed “the pre-1996 copyright notices on the Cool Blue and [Virginia Tech] Barbie doll heads.” Additionally, the district court made other findings regarding Hicks’ misconduct in litigating against Mattel, all of which demonstrated that his conduct fell “below the standards of attorneys practicing in the Central District of California.” The district court singled out the following conduct:</p>

<p id="c0b92623-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hicks argues that even if the district court were justified in sanctioning him under Rule 11 based on Christian’s complaint and the follow-on motions, its conclusion was tainted because it impermissibly considered other misconduct that cannot be sanctioned under Rule 11, such as discovery abuses, misstatements made during oral argument, and conduct in other litigation.</p>
<p id="c0b94d34-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hicks’ argument has merit. While Rule 11 permits the district court to sanction an attorney for conduct regarding “pleading[s], written motion[s], and other paper[s]” that have been signed and filed in a given case, Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(a), it does not authorize sanctions for, among other things, discovery abuses or misstatements made to the court during an oral presentation. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b94d35-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The orders clearly demonstrate that the district court decided, at least in part, to sanction Hicks because he signed and filed a factually and legally meritless complaint and for misrepresentations in subsequent briefing. But the orders, coupled with the supporting examples, also strongly suggest that the court considered extra-pleadings conduct as a basis for Rule 11 sanctions. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b94d36-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The laundry list of Hicks’ outlandish conduct is a long one and raises serious questions as to his respect for the judicial process. Nonetheless, Rule 11 sanctions are limited to “paper[s]” signed in violation of the rule. Conduct in depositions, discovery meetings of counsel, oral representations at hearings, and behavior in prior proceedings do not fall within the ambit of Rule 11. Because we do not know for <span title="419" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-419">p. 419</span>certain whether the district court granted Mattel’s Rule 11 motion as a result of an impermissible intertwining of its conclusion about the complaint’s frivolity and Hicks’ extrinsic misconduct, we must vacate the district court’s Rule 11 orders.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E24_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10E24_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">10</a></span> We decline Mattel’s suggestion that the district court’s sanctions orders could be supported in their entirety under the court’s inherent authority. To impose sanctions under its inherent authority, the district court must “make an explicit finding [which it did not do here] that counsel’s conduct constituted or was tantamount to bad faith.” Primus Auto. Fin. Serv., Inc. v. Batarse, 115 F.3d 644, 648 (9th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). We acknowledge that the district court has a broad array of sanctions options at its disposal: Rule 11, 28 U.S.C. §1927,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E2A_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10E2A_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">11</a></span> and the court’s inherent authority. Each of these sanctions alternatives has its own particular requirements, and it is important that the grounds be separately articulated to assure that the conduct at issue falls within the scope of the sanctions remedy. See, e.g., B.K.B. v. Maui Police Dep’t, 276 F.3d 1091, 1107 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that misconduct committed “in an unreasonable and vexatious manner” that “multiplies the proceedings” violates §1927); Fink v. Gomez, 239 F.3d 989, 991-992 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that sanctions may be imposed under the court’s inherent authority for “bad faith” actions by counsel, “which includes a broad range of willful improper conduct"). On remand, the district court will have an opportunity to delineate the factual and legal basis for its sanctions orders. . . . </p>

<p id="c0b94d3c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But even if sanctions took the form of a fine, it might go to the court rather than the defendant, an outcome that Rule 11(c)(4) explicitly allows—in which case Mattel would have incurred the added expense of a Rule 11 motion with nothing to show for it. Why was Mattel willing to run the risk of throwing good money (in the form of lawyers’ time) after bad? Reread the third paragraph of the opinion; does it suggest that the Rule 11 motion was itself part of a long-range litigation strategy? What message does this motion send to other would-be litigants?

Inroads, Inc., 858 F. Supp. 769, 775 (N.D. Ill. 1994). That statement may not be toothless if the lawyer practices in a state that requires lawyers to notify the state bar of the imposition of sanctions.

<p id="c0b99b6e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now shift our focus from plaintiff to defendant and examine the array of responses available to defendants and the pitfalls and possibilities inherent in each. Suppose a friend comes to you carrying a complaint she was just served. (Chapter 2 gives you more detail about the way in which she might have been served, or how she might have agreed to waive service.) With the complaint, your friend received <span title="422" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-422">p. 422</span>a summons, telling her to respond or face a default judgment. She asks you what she should do. What do you tell her? You would, of course, need to talk with her about the strength of the claims made against her, her interests and goals, and what money she has available for an attorney. But ultimately, she has just three choices: <i>default</i>, make a <i>pre-answer motion</i>, or <i>answer.</i> Consider them in order.</p>

<p id="c0b99b71-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you will see in more detail in Chapter 8, in <i>Peralta v. Heights Medical Center</i> (page 525) a defendant who fails to respond to the complaint can have a default judgment entered against her. Rule 55. There is no reliable estimate of the number of defaults annually, but every year a substantial number of judgments are obtained in this manner. Why? For two reasons, one understandable, the other unfortunate. The understandable reason flows from substantive law. About 60 percent of civil claims are for breach of contract; a large proportion alleges the defendant’s failure to make payments required by a loan or credit agreement. The substantive law does not give defendant many defenses to that claim: If she has not paid, a judgment will likely be entered against her. Under these circumstances, hiring a lawyer to defend the claim may not be a sensible move, if the outcome is foreordained. The unfortunate reason is that, though defendant possesses a meritorious defense, either she does not realize it or knows it but cannot afford to hire a lawyer. Chapter 5 addresses funding of legal representation for needy clients and may help explain why someone with a meritorious claim may nonetheless fail to sue or defend a case against her.</p>

<p id="c0b99b74-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A defendant who does not default can simply proceed to answer the complaint; this will be defendant’s response in the great majority of cases. In her answer, the defendant can include procedural as well as substantive defenses. She can, for example, assert that the court lacks either personal or subject matter jurisdiction, that the allegations of the complaint even if true do not state a claim, and more. But whatever else the defendant does in her answer, she <i>must</i> respond to the substantive allegations of the complaint. She must, that is, either admit or deny that she and the plaintiff entered into a contract, that the plaintiff delivered or failed to deliver the widgets, that she was or was not negligent, and so on. An answer sometimes forces a defendant to admit or deny something she would prefer not to address at all, particularly in the earliest stages of the litigation. An answer can also be expensive. Recall that Rule 11 applies to answers as well as complaints; consider the level of factual investigation required to answer the complaint in <i>Twombly</i>—a defendant with thousands of employees located in many places. Note also that an answer must state certain counterclaims if they are available. And an answer almost certainly leads to additional expenses in the form of discovery—the next step following an answer. So, if a defendant does not want to default but would also prefer <span title="423" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-423">p. 423</span>to avoid the expense and time of framing an answer to the complaint and the subsequent stages of litigation, what other course lies open? Read Rule 12(b). The seven defenses there can be included in an answer or in a pre-answer motion.</p>
<p id="c0b99b75-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike a pleading (e.g., a complaint or an answer), a Rule 12 motion does not require a party to set forth her version of the facts alleged in the complaint. Instead, it is a request that the court take some action in regard to the lawsuit. Civil practice is full of motions—to grant summary judgment, a new trial, extend time to answer, award attorneys’ fees, and so on. We focus here on a subset of motions—the pre-answer motions—that have particular importance at the pleading stage. We will focus first on the Rule 12(b) motions, which carry special power.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0b9c28a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Settling most of these matters will not require significant factual investigation. Sometimes they will, though—remember <i>Hawkins v. Masters Farms</i>, at page 7, in which the parties took depositions and exchanged discovery in support of a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction? Consider also the amount of discovery involved in some of the personal jurisdiction cases from Chapter 2—these decisions were rendered in response to motions to dismiss.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0b9c28b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A pre-answer motion under Rule 12(b) can end a case, the court dismissing it without ever having considered the merits.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0b9c28c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For a defendant, that idea can be very attractive: It will save the costs of answering, discovery and defense on the merits, and end the suit quickly. For the plaintiff, of course, these features make a successful pre-answer motion a result to be avoided at all costs: It will end the suit without letting her get to discovery and the merits of the claim.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b9c28d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even a pre-answer motion that eventually fails may provide a defendant other benefits. Rule 12(a)(1) gives a defendant 21 days to answer the complaint, a period extended to 60 days if the defendant waives service of process. Rule 12(a)(1)(A). That period starts to run when the defendant is served, and includes whatever time it takes the defendant to find a lawyer as well as the factual and legal investigation necessary to frame an answer that complies with the requirements of Rule 11. A pre-answer motion stops the clock; see Rule 12(a)(4). Notice though, that because a motion will be in <span title="424" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-424">p. 424</span>writing, it will thus be subject to Rule 11, so a frivolous pre-answer motion runs the same risk as a frivolous complaint or answer.

<p id="c0b9c28e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Precisely because a Rule 12 motion delays the time for defendant to answer, and delays as well the next stage of the lawsuit, the Rules reflect suspicion that some defendants may use these motions primarily to delay. Rule 12(g) and (h) aim at balancing the availability of these defenses against that possibility. The balance struck poses some traps for the careless defendant’s lawyer. Read Rule 12(g) and (h) and vaccinate yourself against malpractice by working through the following problems; be prepared to cite the language in Rule 12 that supports your response.</p>

<p id="c0b9e9ac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Motion for a More Definite Statement.</i> </b>Rule 12(e) is best understood in historical terms. Under early common law and Code pleading systems, the complaint bore much of the weight of narrowing the parties’ contentions and exposing the issues in dispute. Under such circumstances it was frequently a fair request, as well as a good tactic, to ask the pleader to “make more definite and certain” his contentions. Such motions served as a form of discovery not otherwise permitted. Though it seems inconsistent with the idea of notice pleading, an analogous motion was carried over into the original Rules; there it proved to be the subject of more judicial rulings than any other part of the Federal Rules, often at the hands of judges unfamiliar with the philosophy underlying the Rules. At present, Rule 12(e) is infrequently, and almost never successfully, invoked. (For an example of one unsuccessful effort, see <i>Bell v. Novick Transfer</i>, supra page 19.) Some very vague claims will be subject to a 12(b)(6) motion; see <i>Twombly</i> and <i>Iqbal.</i> In other circumstances, in which the pleader has a fair idea what the claim is about but wants to know more about the precise nature of the pleader’s case, discovery beckons.</p>
<p id="c0b9e9ad-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Motion to Strike.</i> </b>Rule 12(f) plays two quite different roles:</p>
<p id="c0b9e9ae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its most common use the motion to strike allows a party to challenge a <i>part</i> of a pleading that fails under the substantive law, even though the rest of the pleading states a claim or defense. Suppose, for example, <i>A</i>’s spouse is killed in an auto accident with <i>B</i>, and <i>A</i> sues for wrongful death, seeking punitive damages. If the applicable tort law bars punitive damages for negligently inflicted injuries, defendant may move to strike the punitive damages allegations (though not the whole claim). See Mills v. Fox, 421 F. Supp. 519 (E.D.N.Y. 1976). In this use, Rule 12(f) acts like a Rule 12(b)(6) motion directed to a single allegation, or cluster of allegations, rather than to the whole complaint. See Fry v. Lamb Rental Tools, 275 F. Supp. 283 (W.D. La. 1967) (claimed damages for sorrow, grief, loss of love, affection, and companionship not recoverable under state law; motion to strike therefore granted).</p>
<p id="c0b9e9af-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its other, less common, use, the motion to strike forces removal of irrelevant and prejudicial allegations in a pleading. Suppose a complaint or answer, in addition to alleging facts relevant to the claim or defense, makes gratuitously nasty remarks about a party. Under such conditions the court will entertain a motion to strike any “redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.” Courts will grant such a motion if allegations in the complaint have no relation to the case or are unnecessarily confusing; if the complaint is overly long and detailed (especially if it contains excessive evidentiary information); or if allegations are unnecessarily derogatory. See, e.g., Hughes v. Kaiser Jeep Corp., 40 F.R.D. 89, 93 (D.S.C. 1966) (striking reference to car as “death trap"); Budget Dress Corp. v. ILGWU, 25 F.R.D. <span title="426" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-426">p. 426</span>506 (S.D.N.Y. 1959) (striking defenses based on alleged conspiracy between plaintiff and underworld elements described as “strong arm men” and “racketeers"). Courts regularly point out that such motions are not favored, waste time, should not be granted as to background information, and should not be granted if the court is at all in doubt. See, e.g., Fuchs Sugars &amp; Syrups, Inc. v. Amstar Corp., 402 F. Supp. 636 (S.D.N.Y. 1975). Accordingly, the decision to strike may depend on whether the allegations are likely to prejudice the moving party, which might occur if the pleadings will be read to the jury, and, if so, whether limiting instructions will be given.</p>
<p id="c0b9e9b0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.</i> </b>Rule 12(c) deserves mention here, though it comes, by definition, after an answer to the complaint. Suppose plaintiff alleges breach of contract, and defendant’s answer consists solely of the allegation that he failed to pay his debt because he was supporting a sick parent. Even such an admirable act is not a defense to breach of contract, and defendant hasn’t denied any of the allegations of the complaint. Under those conditions the plaintiff could move for judgment on the pleadings. The court would, essentially, match up the allegations of the complaint and those of the answer, and decide whether judgment for the plaintiff should be entered on the basis of the pleadings. On this hypothetical scenario, the answer would be yes: Plaintiff wins because the only “defense” stated is legally insufficient.</p>
<p id="c0ba10c1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another case suitable for judgment on the pleadings might occur if the complaint’s allegations made it clear that the statute of limitations had run on a claim. Defendant might answer, asserting the statute as a defense and move for judgment on the pleadings. See Jin v. Ministry of State Security, 254 F. Supp. 2d 61 (D.D.C. 2003) (dismissing defamation claim against Chinese television program when complaint alleged that most recent broadcast of program had occurred outside the applicable one-year statute of limitations).</p>
<p id="c0ba10c2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The motion for judgment on the pleadings will resolve a case in those relatively rare circumstances in which the parties’ pleadings reveal agreement about the relevant facts and only the applicable law is in question. In such instances, slogging through discovery serves no use.</p>

Common law pleaders referred to “traverses” (modern-day denials) and “pleas in confession and avoidance” (our modern-day affirmative defenses). Both live on, though under less colorful names.</p>

<p id="c0ba37e0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you consider what you already intuitively know about the legal system, you will understand why the denial is overwhelmingly the most common response to a complaint. Unlike the situations in <i>Twombly</i>, <i>Iqbal</i>, or <i>Haddle</i>, most complaints do not involve edge-of-the-law allegations or disputes about the required form of pleading. Instead, they involve claims where the defendant agrees that she would be liable if she had done what the plaintiff alleges—but says she didn’t do it. Under such circumstances, the right response is to deny one or more of the relevant allegations of the complaint. Rule 8(b) requires the defendant to deny only those allegations that she actually disputes, and Rule 8(b)(6) provides any allegation that is not denied is deemed admitted.</p>
<p id="c0ba37e1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These simple principles, however, conflict with defendants’ understandable tendency to “deny everything.” At common law, the form of plea called the “general issue” was permitted for many forms of action; this plea placed all allegations of the declaration at issue. The modern analogue is the general denial, an allegation that denies each and every allegation of the complaint. A more limited form of general denial denies each and every allegation of a specific paragraph or group of paragraphs.</p>
<p id="c0ba37e2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is nothing bad in theory about the general denial. The problem is that extremely few cases arise in which the defendant can plausibly deny every allegation or, as is more common, every allegation not relating to the names and citizenship of the parties. Nevertheless, it is still not uncommon for parties to interpose a general denial when they mean only to deny the major operative allegations of the complaint. Courts condemn casual, blanket denials because they require parties to spend needless time ferreting out the real items in dispute. A defendant who enters such a general denial may well find himself on the wrong end of a Rule 11 inquiry.</p>

R. Civ. P. 8(b), 28 U.S.C. provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0ba8621-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A party shall state in short and plain terms his defenses to each claim asserted and shall admit or deny the averments upon which the adverse party relies. . . . Denials shall fairly meet the substance of the averments denied. When a pleader intends in good faith to deny only a part or a qualification of an averment, he shall specify so much of it as is true and material and shall deny only the remainder.</p>
</div></li>
</ol>
<p id="c0ba8622-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, it is quite clear that defendant does not deny the averment in paragraph 5 that the fork lift came into contact with plaintiff, since it admits, in the answers to interrogatories, that an investigation of an occurrence of the accident had been made and that a report dated February 10, 1953, was sent to its insurance company stating “While Frank Zielinski was riding on bumper of chisel and holding rope to secure cargo, the chisel truck collided with another chisel truck operated by Sandy Johnson causing injuries to Frank Zielinski’s legs and hurt head of Sandy Johnson.” Compliance with the above-mentioned rule required that defendant file a more specific answer than a general denial. A specific denial of parts of this paragraph and specific admission of other parts would have warned plaintiff that he had sued the wrong defendant.</p>
<p id="c0baad33-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Paragraph 8.23 of Moore’s Federal Practice (2nd Edition) Vol. II, p. 1680, says: “In such a case, the defendant should make clear just what he is denying and what he is admitting.” This answer to paragraph 5 does not make clear to plaintiff the defenses he must be prepared to meet. . . . </p>

<li class=""><p id="c0baad34-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the circumstances of this case, principles of equity require that defendant be estopped from denying agency because, otherwise, its inaccurate statements and statements in the record, which it knew (or had the means of knowing within its control) were inaccurate, will have deprived plaintiff of his right of action.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="c0baad35-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If Interrogatory 2 had been answered accurately by saying that employees of Carload Contractors, Inc. had turned the matter over to the insurance company,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN110EA_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N110EA_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">11</a></span> it seems clear that plaintiff would have realized his mistake. The fact that if Sandy Johnson had testified accurately, the plaintiff could have brought its action against the proper party defendant within the statutory period of limitations is also a factor to be considered, since defendant was represented at the deposition and received knowledge of the inaccurate testimony.</p>
<p id="c0baad37-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At least one appellate court has stated that the doctrine of equitable estoppel will be applied to prevent a party from taking advantage of the statute of limitations where the plaintiff has been misled by conduct of such party. See <i>Peters v. Public Service <span title="431" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-431">p. 431</span>Corporation</i>. In that case, the court said, “Of course, defendants were under no duty to advise complainants’ attorney of his error, other than by appropriate pleadings, but neither did defendants have a right, knowing of the mistake, to foster it by its acts of omission.” This doctrine has been held to estop a party from taking advantage of a document of record where the misleading conduct occurred after the recording, so that application of this doctrine would not necessarily be precluded in a case such as this where the misleading answers to interrogatories and depositions were subsequent to the filing of the answer, even if the denial in the answer had been sufficient.</p>
<p id="c0baad38-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since this is a pre-trial order, it may be modified at the trial if the trial judge determines from the facts which then appear that justice so requires.</p>

What happens if defendant is not sure, or if she believes that plaintiff’s allegations may be true? Some defendants seek to evade the requirements of Rule 8 by “putting plaintiff to his proof.” That practice, at odds with the spirit of Rule 8(b), drew a spirited rebuke from one federal judge who had seen it tried in one case too many:</p>

Here [defendants’] counsel has engaged in a particularly vexatious violation of that most fundamental aspect of federal pleading.

<p id="c0bb2285-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Zielinski</i> demonstrates that the traverse lives on in the form of the general or specific denial. This section asks where the borderline lies between a denial and an affirmative defense—the old plea in confession and avoidance. A defense is anything that defeats recovery: A denial of a critical allegation of a complaint is a defense. By contrast, an affirmative defense is an additional allegation—not just a denial of an allegation of the complaint—that defeats liability. For example, in a negligence case, a denial of negligence would be a defense, and an allegation that the statute of limitations had run would be an affirmative defense. Defendants, when they answer a complaint, must include any affirmative defenses they wish to assert in their answer. A nonexhaustive list of affirmative defenses can be found at Rule 8(c). Defendants then bear the burden of persuasion at trial on any affirmative defense they raise. In <i>Jones v. Bock</i>, you saw the U.S. Supreme Court sorting out whether the plaintiff/prisoner’s exhaustion of administrative remedies was part of a properly pleaded claim or was an affirmative defense. An affirmative defense, held the Court (supra page 403).</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0bb2288-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a review of the material thus far, explain why the ruling in <i>Jones</i> means that a defendant wishing to rely on Jones’s failure to exhaust administrative remedies cannot use a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to raise that issue.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0bb2289-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Take things one step further. Suppose that after the decision in <i>Jones v. Bock</i> a similar case arises, in which the defendant warden intends to rely on the prisoner-plaintiff’s failure to exhaust remedies. Prisoner pleads unconstitutional mistreatment. Defendant admits the allegations of the complaint and asserts no affirmative defenses, but intends to introduce at trial evidence concerning failure to exhaust as his sole defense. As a further review, explain what motion the plaintiff should make in order to prevail at this stage of the case.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0bb228a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="434" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-434">p. 434</span>Now suppose that on remand after the decision in <i>Jones v. Bock</i>, the warden-defendant is offered a chance to amend the answer. Figuring that everyone understands that he will challenge Jones’s exhaustion of remedies, warden does not amend. The case comes on for a hearing, at which the defendant wants to offer evidence tending to show that Jones did not exhaust his administrative remedies. Jones could object to the evidence, arguing that the pleadings failed to raise the issue of exhaustion: By omitting the defense of failure to exhaust administrative remedies in the answer, the defendant had waived the defense, and evidence concerning a waived defense is inadmissible.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0bb228d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case goes to trial, where both plaintiff and defendants offer evidence about the issue of exhaustion. There are some documents, but much of the evidence concerns oral statements that Jones either did or did not make to various prison staff members. With the evidence in this state, the court’s instruction to the jury on burdens of persuasion may matter. Such an instruction could say, “On the issue of exhaustion, you should find for the defendants unless you are persuaded by the preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff exhausted his administrative remedies at the prison.” Or it could say, “On the issue of exhaustion, you should find for the plaintiff unless you are convinced by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies.” In a close case—like this one—it may matter which instruction is given. After <i>Jones v. Bock</i>, which instruction should the district judge give?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0bb228e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One point of Note 4b is that an element’s status as a part of the complaint or as an affirmative defense does not end at the pleading stage but often ripples through the entire lawsuit. That makes it important to know when some element of a case rests on the plaintiff or defendant to plead, whether it is part of plaintiff’s claim or an affirmative defense. For the great majority of common claims and defenses the matter is well settled. But this is not always so, and, unfortunately, there are neither clear rules nor well-settled principles for deciding doubtful cases.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0bb499f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 8(c)(1) dodges the matter by coyly telling us that the list of affirmative defenses “include[s]” those it listed; as the Court noted in <i>Jones v. Bock</i>, it’s understood that this list does not include all such defenses. So one has to trudge through statutes and case law in some instances.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0bb49a0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reading such cases, one occasionally finds unhelpfully broad pronouncements about how one aspect of proof or another is inherently part (or not part) of the elements of the claim—and therefore (or therefore not) put at issue by a general denial. That is of course circular: It’s part of the claim if the court so rules and it’s an affirmative defense if the court rules otherwise.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0bb49a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="435" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-435">p. 435</span>It may prove more helpful to think of a function of pleading as preventing unfair surprise. Most cases won’t involve a statute of limitations defense, for example. If the defendant intends to raise that defense, it should do so in a way that does not surprise the plaintiff—with an affirmative defense. New York State civil procedure rules structure pleading in this manner. See N.Y. Civ. Prac. L. &amp; R. §3018(b) (requiring pleading of “all matters which if not pleaded would be likely to take the adverse party by surprise or would raise issues of fact not appearing on the face of a prior pleading"). Should the Rules adopt such a principle—or would that just lead to litigation over which defenses were “likely to surprise"?</p></li>

<p id="c0bb49a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once upon a time, the dance of pleading could go on and on, as the legal system sought to extract from the parties exact agreement about which questions of law and fact were in dispute. That effort yielded pleadings with wonderfully exotic names: replication, rejoinder (a word that lives on in a colloquial sense), surrejoinder, rebutter, and surrebutter. Today the legal system depends on discovery, the summary judgment motion, and the pretrial process to identify the issues of real contention.</p>
<p id="c0bb49a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a consequence, in most cases, the pleadings stop with the answer. This is true whether the answer simply denies certain allegations of the complaint or contains new matter in the form of various affirmative defenses. There are two small exceptions to this principle.</p>
<p id="c0bb49a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose the answer contains a counterclaim. Rule 7(a)(3) requires an answer by the plaintiff if the defendant’s answer contains “a counterclaim designated as a counterclaim.” If the defendant’s answer contains allegations that are labeled as affirmative defenses, then no reply is required even if the same facts—for example, fraud in a contract dispute—could have supported counterclaims.</p>
<p id="c0bb49a7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, Rule 7(a)(7) allows a judge to order a reply to an answer. When might a judge do so? Suppose an answer contained both denials and several affirmative defenses: Might a judge think that it would clarify the contested terrain if she ordered a reply?</p>

The complaint invokes diversity jurisdiction, alleging that the water heater was defective and asserts that Landlord is liable for having a defective water heater. Landlord files an answer asserting that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the doctrine of strict liability for defective products only applies to manufacturers and sellers of products, not to a landlord. At trial, Plaintiff proves that the heater was defective but Landlord continues to assert that it is not liable because strict liability does not apply to landlords. Plaintiff moves the court to strike this defense on the ground that it should have been made in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, prior to answering, and was therefore waived. What result?</p></li>

<p id="c0bbbeea-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pleadings provide at least a preliminary definition of what a lawsuit is about. But modern civil litigation builds itself around the idea that discovery may cause claims and defenses to change as facts unknown at the time of pleading emerge. Rule 15 both allows such revisions of the parties’ original stories and limits the extent and timing of such changes in the plot lines.</p>
<p id="c0bbbeeb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A reading of the Rule suggests a tension between two goals: easy amendment, which allows the pleadings to reflect the parties’ changed view of the case as it develops; and the notion of “prejudice,” which reflects the idea that at some point the other side has to make decisions about how to investigate and present its case, decisions that become difficult if the story it has to meet continually shifts. Before dealing with the difficult issues, read the Rule and use the following problems to orient you to its structure.</p>

A slide was delivered from a Purity warehouse to Kimberly Village, and was installed by Kimberly employees. On July 15, 1972, Jerry A. Beeck was injured while using the slide at a social gathering sponsored at Kimberly Village by his employer, Harker Wholesale Meats, Inc. Soon after the accident investigations were undertaken by representatives of the separate insurers of Harker and Kimberly Village. On October 31, 1972, Aquaslide first learned of the accident through a letter sent by a representative of Kimberly’s insurer to Aquaslide, advising that “one of your Queen Model #Q-3D slides” was involved in the accident. Aquaslide forwarded this notification to its insurer. Aquaslide’s insurance adjuster made an on-site investigation of the slide in May 1973, and also interviewed persons connected with the ordering and assembly of the slide. An inter-office letter dated September 23, 1973, indicates that Aquaslide’s insurer was of the opinion the “Aquaslide in question was definitely manufactured by our insured.” The complaint was filed October 15, 1973.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11354_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N11354_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">3</a></span> Investigators for three different insurance companies, representing Harker, Kimberly and the defendant, had concluded that the slide had been manufactured by Aquaslide, and the defendant, with no information to the contrary, answered the complaint on December 12, 1973, and admitted that it “designed, manufactured, assembled and sold” the slide in question.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1135A_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1135A_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">4</a></span> The statute of limitations on plaintiff’s personal injury claim expired on July 15, 1974.

<p id="c0bc333a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This court in <i>Hanson v. Hunt Oil Co</i>. held that “[p]rejudice <i>must be shown</i>.” (Emphasis added). The burden is on the party opposing the amendment to show such prejudice. In ruling on a motion for leave to amend, the trial court must inquire into the issue of prejudice to the opposing party, in light of the particular facts of the case.</p>
<p id="c0bc333b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Certain principles apply to appellate review of a trial court’s grant or denial of a motion to amend pleadings. First, as noted in <i>Foman v. Davis</i>, allowance or denial of leave to amend lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and is reviewable only for an abuse of discretion. The appellate court must view the case in the posture in which the trial court acted in ruling on the motion to amend.</p>
<p id="c0bc333c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is evident from the order of the district court that in the exercise of its discretion in ruling on defendant’s motion for leave to amend, it searched the record for evidence of bad faith, prejudice and undue delay which might be sufficient to overbalance the mandate of Rule 15(a), F. R. Civ. P., and <i>Foman v. Davis</i>, that leave to amend should be “freely given.” Plaintiffs had not at any time conceded that the slide in question had not been manufactured by the defendant, and at the time the motion for leave to amend was at issue, the court had to decide whether the defendant should be permitted to litigate a material factual issue on its merits.</p>
<p id="c0bc333d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In inquiring into the issue of bad faith, the court noted the fact that the defendant, in initially concluding that it had manufactured the slide, relied upon the conclusions of three different insurance companies,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN113AA_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N113AA_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">6</a></span> each of which had conducted an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the accident. This reliance upon investigations of three insurance companies, and the fact that “no contention has been made by anyone that the defendant influenced this possibly erroneous conclusion,” persuaded the court that “defendant has not acted in such bad faith as to be precluded from contesting the issue of manufacture at trial.” The court further found “[t]o the extent that ’blame’ is to be spread regarding the original identification, the record indicates that it should be shared equally.” In considering the issue of prejudice that might result to the plaintiffs from the granting of the motion for leave to amend, the trial court held that the facts presented to it did not support plaintiffs’ assertion that, because of the running of the two-year Iowa statute of limitations on personal <span title="441" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-441">p. 441</span>injury claims, the allowance of the amendment would sound the “death knell” of the litigation. In order to accept plaintiffs’ argument, the court would have had to assume that the defendant would prevail at trial on the factual issue of manufacture of the slide, and further that plaintiffs would be foreclosed, should the amendment be allowed, from proceeding against other parties if they were unsuccessful in pressing their claim against Aquaslide. On the state of the record before it, the trial court was unwilling to make such assumptions,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN113B2_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N113B2_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">7</a></span> and concluded “[u]nder these circumstances, the court deems that the possible prejudice to the plaintiffs is an insufficient basis on which to deny the proposed amendment.” The court reasoned that the amendment would merely allow the defendant to contest a disputed factual issue at trial, and further that it would be prejudicial to the defendant to deny the amendment.</p>
<p id="c0bc3341-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court also held that defendant and its insurance carrier, in investigating the circumstances surrounding the accident, had not been so lacking in diligence as to dictate a denial of the right to litigate the factual issue of manufacture of the slide.</p>

The slide which plaintiff Jerry A. Beeck was using at the time of his accident was very similar in appearance to an Aquaslide product, and was without identifying marks. Kimberly Village had in fact ordered an Aquaslide for its swimming pool, and thought it had received one. After Meyer’s inspection and Aquaslide’s subsequent assertion that it was not an Aquaslide product, plaintiffs elected to stand on their contention that it was in fact an Aquaslide. This raised a substantial issue of material fact which, if resolved in defendant’s favor, would exonerate defendant from liability.</p>
<p id="c0bc5a5a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff Jerry A. Beeck had been severely injured, and he and his wife together were seeking damages arising out of those injuries in the sum of $2,225,000.00. Evidence of plaintiffs’ injuries and damages would clearly have taken up several days of trial time, and because of the severity of the injuries, may have been prejudicial to the defendant’s claim of non-manufacture. The jury, by special interrogatory, found that the slide had not been manufactured by Aquaslide. That finding has not been questioned on appeal. Judicial economy, beneficial to all the parties, was obviously served by the trial court’s grant of a separate trial. We hold the Rule 42(b) separation was not an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p id="c0bc5a5b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0bc8176-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First assume, as the district court found, that Aquaslide and its insurers acted completely in good faith and that it was in fact difficult to tell the real from the counterfeit slide.

Assume the amendment had been denied, and Aquaslide had remained in the case. How would defendant have responded to the claim of negligent manufacture? Would it have shown its own design, testing, manufacturing, and safety procedures or those of the actual manufacturer? Assuming the latter, what would happen if it didn’t know who manufactured the slide?

The Beecks filed a second suit in state court, still against Aquaslide. This time, however, they did not claim a defective product but “reckless misrepresentation” made in the pleadings in the federal litigation. Plaintiffs’ theory was that misrepresentations in the answer (inaccurately admitting that the product was made by Aquaslide) had caused the Beecks to lose their chance to sue the real manufacturer within the statute of limitations. The Beecks presented evidence summarized in Note 2b—showing that Aquaslide should have been on notice that there were counterfeit slides on the market. Plaintiffs argued that defendant was therefore reckless in admitting manufacture without a more complete investigation.</p>
<p id="c0bca88f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case came before the Iowa Supreme Court twice, once in 1981 and again in 1984. In 1984 the court upheld a recovery of over $3 million based on a misrepresentation theory. But, analogizing the Beecks’ claim to a legal malpractice action, the court also said that, in order to prevail, the plaintiffs would have to show not only that they would have recovered a judgment against the actual manufacturer but also that the judgment would have been collectible. Beeck v. Aquaslide ’N’ Dive Corp., 350 N.W.2d 149 (Iowa 1984). The court remanded the case for yet another trial on the issue of the collectability of the award against the actual manufacturer.

Rule 15(c) gives plaintiffs some leeway to name new parties or new claims after the statute of limitations: It allows an amended pleading to be treated as though it was filed on the date of the original pleading.

In <i>Azarbal</i>, the original complaint alleged negligence in the performance of an amniocentesis on the plaintiff, resulting in injury to the fetus. After the statute of limitations had expired, the plaintiff sought to amend the complaint to add a claim that the doctor failed to obtain her informed consent prior to performing a sterilization procedure on her because the doctor did not tell her that the fetus had probably been injured by the amniocentesis. The district court [in <i>Azarbal</i>] found that “the original complaint provided adequate notice of any claims Ms. Azarbal would have arising from the amniocentesis, including a claim that Dr. Palacio should have revealed that the procedure had caused fetal injury.” The instant case is clearly distinguishable from <i>Azarbal</i>.

<p id="c0bccfb0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We must conclude that Moore’s new claim does not arise out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence as the claims in the original complaint.

<p id="c0bcf6c6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this diversity action, plaintiff seeks damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained when he slipped and fell while playing basketball on defendant’s recreational basketball court on November 29, 1991. Defendant is a not-for-profit corporation licensed and doing business as a drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility in Westfield, Pennsylvania. Plaintiff is a resident of Western New York.</p>
<p id="c0bcf6c7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The original complaint, filed on October 1, 1993, alleges that plaintiff was injured while he was a rehabilitation patient at defendant’s Westfield facility, and was participating in a mandatory exercise program. Plaintiff claims that the basketball court was negligently maintained by defendant.</p>
<p id="c0bcf6c8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 25, 1994, this court granted plaintiff’s motion for substitution of new counsel. On September 1, 1994, plaintiff moved to amend his complaint to add a new cause of action for “counseling malpractice.” According to plaintiff’s counsel, <span title="447" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-447">p. 447</span>investigation and discussions undertaken after his substitution as counsel indicated to him that a malpractice claim was warranted under the circumstances. Defendant objects to the amendment on the grounds that the counseling malpractice claim does not relate back to the original pleading and is therefore barred by Pennsylvania’s two-year statute of limitations.</p>

<p id="c0bcf6ca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that once time for amending a pleading as of right has expired, a party may request leave of court to amend, [and “The court should freely give leave when justice so requires"]. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)[(2)]. . . . </p>
<p id="c0bcf6cb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The relation back doctrine is based upon the principle that one who has been given notice of litigation concerning a given transaction or occurrence has been provided with all the protection that statutes of limitation are designed to afford. Thus, if the litigant has been advised at the outset of the general facts from which the belatedly asserted claim arises, the amendment will relate back even though the statute of limitations may have run in the interim.</p>
<p id="c0bcf6cc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An amendment which changes the legal theory of the case is appropriate if the factual situation upon which the action depends remains the same and has been brought to the defendant’s attention by the original pleading. . . . </p>
<p id="c0bcf6cd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the original complaint alleges that plaintiff was injured when he slipped and fell on a wet, muddy basketball court “while participating in a mandatory exercise program  . . . ” at defendant’s rehabilitation facility. Plaintiff alleges several instances of defendant’s negligent conduct, such as failure to maintain the premises safely, failure to warn, failure to inspect and failure to “properly supervise and/or instruct plaintiff.  . . . ” The proposed amendment seeks to allege that plaintiff “was caused to fall while playing in an outdoor basketball court. . . . in an exercise program mandated as part of his treatment in the rehabilitation program,  . . . ” and that “the rehabilitation and counseling care rendered. . . . was negligently, carelessly and unskillfully performed.”</p>
<p id="c0bcf6ce-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The allegations in the original and amended complaints derive from the same nucleus of operative facts involving injury suffered by plaintiff on November 29, 1991. It is true that a claim for professional malpractice invokes an entirely different duty and conduct on the part of the defendant than does a claim for negligent maintenance of the premises. However, the original complaint advised defendant of the same transaction or occurrence giving rise to these different theories of negligence. Indeed, the original complaint alleged that participation in the exercise program was mandatory, and that the injury was caused by defendant’s failure to “properly supervise and/or instruct plaintiff.  . . . ” These allegations not only gave defendant sufficient notice of the general facts surrounding the occurrence, but also alerted defendant to the possibility of a claim based on negligent performance of professional duties. This is all that is required for relation back under Rule 15(c).</p>
<p id="c0bcf6cf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant contends that it will be unduly prejudiced by the amendment because it will have to return to the drawing board to prepare an entirely new defense. However, as plaintiff points out, the period for discovery has not yet expired, depositions <span title="448" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-448">p. 448</span>of defendant’s personnel have not yet been taken, and expert witness information has not been exchanged. In addition, the parties have consented to trial before the undersigned, thereby simplifying any further supervision of discovery and the conduct and review of pretrial matters and dispositive motions.</p>
<p id="c0bd1de0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, there has been no showing of undue delay or bad faith on the part of plaintiff. . . . </p>

<li class=""><p id="c0bd1de8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Relation-back cases test our belief in statutes of limitations and our idea of a claim. Statutes of limitations are intended to limit the amount of time that a plaintiff has to bring her claim; the relation-back doctrine extends this limit. One could, theoretically, have a doctrine that permitted relation back of any subsequent amendment, no matter how unrelated to the original claim. Such a doctrine would do away altogether with the statute of limitations. Rule 15(c) does something different: It allows relation back only for claims sufficiently related to those described in the original pleading that the defendant should be on notice of the dispute.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0bd1de9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If one allows relation back for “related” claims, the question becomes how to define relatedness. One possibility would be on the basis of legal theory: Any tort claim could be joined to an initial claim for a tort, and so on. Instead, Rule 15(c) defines the line between permitted and unpermitted amendments in terms of “the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in the original pleading.” That language is purposely general, and <span title="449" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-449">p. 449</span>courts will inevitably perceive “conduct, transaction, [and] occurrence” in different-sized packages. Yet the language is clearly focused on the factual allegations in the complaint, as opposed to the legal theories.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0bd1dea-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Moore v. Baker</i>, the court finds that the allegations of medical malpractice did not relate back to the allegations of failure to get informed consent for the operation. In <i>Bonerb v. Richard J. Caron Foundation</i>, the court finds that the claim of “counseling malpractice” did relate back to the allegations of negligent maintenance of the basketball court.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0bd44fb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Are the cases distinguishable? If one focuses just on the “conduct, transaction, or occurrence” language, no. In both cases people presented themselves to health care professionals for treatment and are alleging bad outcomes caused by those professionals. But one plaintiff gets to amend and the other does not. That seems unjustified.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0bd44fc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor does it help to point out that in <i>Moore</i> the plaintiff is trying to change the legal theory of her case while in <i>Bonerb</i> the plaintiff is merely shifting from one set of facts to another to support the claim of negligence. Rule 15(c) specifically rejects the idea that amendments should turn on legal theories.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0bd44fd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Focus instead on the stage of litigation at which the motions came in the two cases. Articulate an argument that the cases are both correctly decided because of the timing of the motions to amend. Here’s a hint: The best argument is based more on the Rule 15(a) requirements you read about in <i>Beeck</i> than those in Rule 15(c).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0bd44fe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some of the most spectacular relation-back cases occur when the plaintiff wants to change not just a legal theory, but the party sued. One might think that basic ideas of fair notice would prevent such amendments. After all, how could a prospective defendant have fair notice of anything if he didn’t know he was being sued? But even such an amendment can relate back under some conditions. Read carefully Rule 15(c)(1)(C).</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0bd44ff-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The ordinary version of such cases involves a corporation sued under the wrong name or an individual whose name is misspelled. In such instances, the “right” defendant was served with process, and thus knows of the suit, and of plaintiff’s mistake; the courts have often allowed such amendments to relate back.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0bd4500-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Apply Rule 15(c)(1)(C) to the facts of <i>Zielinski v. Philadelphia Piers</i>, supra page 428. The present version of this Rule was not in effect at the time <i>Zielinski</i> was decided. Suppose it had been. Could the court have avoided the awkward step of forcing the defendant to admit a false statement by instead permitting an amendment to change the defendant?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0bd4501-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now apply Rule 15(c)(1)(C) to the facts of <i>Beeck v. Aquaslide ’N’ Dive Corp.</i> Imagine that Beeck had discovered the identity of the true manufacturer of the slide after the statute of limitations had run, and equitable estoppel was not an option. Could the plaintiffs have amended the complaint to name the new defendant and have the claim relate back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)?</p></li>

As a result, notice pleading eliminates fewer claims than its predecessors. As a further result, however, false positives—meritless cases that survive pleading and go into expensive discovery—have raised concerns. <i>Twombly</i> and <i>Iqbal</i> suggest that judges have heard those concerns, and have, by judicial interpretation, tightened the pleading regime for some subset of cases. How large that subset is, how many cases it will eliminate, and how well the plausibility pleading standard does at sorting meritless from meritorious cases will emerge only after many more judicial decisions and their assessment.</p>
<p id="c0bd4504-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next chapter, on discovery, describes what happens in a case once it gets past the pleading stage. During discovery, parties can spend a great deal of time and money uncovering damaging information about the other side. Efforts to dismiss claims at the pleading stage are in no small part motivated by an interest in avoiding discovery. In other words, discovery explains, in significant part, what all the fuss raised at the pleading stage is really about. Broad discovery is the civil procedure system’s response to the scanty information historically conveyed by notice pleading. As you consider the next chapter, bear in mind that the current structure of discovery is in substantial part a response to decisions made long ago about our pleading system.</p>

<p id="c0bde169-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q1.</b>  B is correct. The defense is waived unless defendant is allowed to amend his answer to include the affirmative defense. Moreover, a court is likely to deny defendant’s request to amend unless defendant can show that information just uncovered in discovery—such as facts showing that plaintiff knew or should have known of his claim earlier than everyone previously assumed—justify amendment.</p>
<p id="c0bde16a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q2.</b>  Only C is correct. A is wrong because the complaint states a claim if its allegations are true; Manufacturer thinks they are not true, so a 12(b)(6) motion is not the right response. B is wrong because this is not an affirmative defense; it’s instead a way of explaining <i>why</i> an allegation is false—something that should be done by denying the allegation. D is wrong because the allegation neither fails under substantive law nor is a particularly prejudicial or scandalous assertion.</p>
<p id="c0bde16b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q3.</b>  B is correct; see Rule 12(h)(2).</p>
<p id="c0be087c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4.</b>  Only D is correct. A is wrong because the case interprets Rule 8, not Rule 9. B is wrong because the opinion specifically rejects this interpretation, insisting that it applies to all cases. C is wrong precisely because <i>Iqbal</i> departed from a long line of cases interpreting Rule 8 in a quite different way.</p>
<p id="c0be087d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q5.</b>  Only B is correct: A motion to strike will allow the judge to rule on the validity of the two erroneously asserted affirmative defenses and to eliminate them from the case. A is wrong because injunctions are not directed to procedural <span title="453" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-453">p. 453</span>errors in litigation; a Rule 12(f) motion will have the same effect. C is wrong because, once the affirmative defenses are eliminated, the pleadings reveal a dispute: an allegation of unpaid debts and a denial of that allegation. D is wrong because a 12(b)(6) motion is directed to a claim, not to a defense.</p>
<p id="c0be087e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q6.</b>  A (in a roundabout way) and D are correct. Take D first: On a 12(b) motion the court takes as factually true the allegations of the complaint and decides if they state a claim; in <i>Haddle</i>, the issue was what two key words in the statute meant. A is correct in a roundabout way because the only basis for federal jurisdiction in the case was <i>if</i> the complaint stated a claim arising under federal law, and the only candidate for such a federal law was the statute whose meaning was at stake: Because the Court decided the case for Haddle, that also meant it stayed in federal court. B is wrong because that would require a court to decide whether in fact Haddle had been fired in retaliation, a question not raised by Garrison’s 12(b)(6) motion. C is wrong because <i>Haddle</i>, a pre-<i>Iqbal</i> case, assumed the validity of notice pleading.</p>
<p id="c0be087f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q7.</b>  A, C, and D are correct responses. B is wrong because Rule 8(d) permits alternative claims or defenses. A is correct because Rule 15(a)(1) allows amendment of a pleading “as a matter of course” within 21 days of serving it. C is correct because the claim—now with the required allegation of causation—arises from the same occurrence “set out” in the original complaint, and thus will be treated as having been filed on the same date as the original complaint (that’s what “relates back” means). D is correct because relation back won’t solve plaintiff’s problem if in fact the statute had run before the original complaint was filed—and defendant can so contend if he pleads the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense.</p>
