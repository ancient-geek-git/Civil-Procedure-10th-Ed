<p id="c0eb59db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appeals in U.S. litigation are a booming business. Over the past 50 years, federal civil appeals have increased at a rate one and one-half times faster than the increase in lawsuits filed. This increase has come even though one may appeal only from a judgment and, as we have seen, fewer than one-third of federal civil cases end in a judgment. Moreover, this increase has come even though fewer than 10 percent of federal cases are reversed on appeal.</p>
<p id="c0eb59dc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appeals are the setting for particularly fierce battles between two goals of civil procedure: fairness and justice. Fairness dictates that parties should win or lose depending on their compliance with procedural rules and the quality of their arguments. Justice dictates that the “right” party should prevail, regardless of such technicalities. Because the system embraces both goals, one must frequently yield to the other, and the conflict appears starkly in appellate litigation.</p>
<p id="c0eb59dd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike some other legal systems, the U.S. litigation system operates with a heavy presumption that most trial court decisions are correct. U.S. appellate courts do not supervise trial courts. They do not have jurisdiction to review many trial court decisions and orders that might have been erroneously decided. And when they can review trial court decisions, they may reverse only if an error appears in the record of the trial court proceedings, only if it is an error the appealing party pointed out below, and only if the error in question is harmful—that is, if it is likely to have changed the outcome of the case.</p>
<p id="c0eb59de-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both practical and doctrinal walls insulate trial court decisions. A word about some of the practical ones is in order. Strategic decisions can turn out to be wrong: You think you have a fine venue, so pass on an objection to it, only <span title="662" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-662">p. 662</span>to find that the judge seems to hate you. Having made so many evidentiary objections that the jury is becoming irritated, you make a tactical decision to pass on one—only to find out too late that the jury thought that document fatal to your cause. Page limits for appellate briefs require you to focus on one or two erroneous rulings—perhaps passing on one that the appellate court would have found substantial. These types of strategic decisions can make or break a case but cannot be appealed if they do not involve an error by the trial court. In a particularly egregious case, a disappointed party might be able to bring a malpractice action against her attorney, but she cannot appeal the trial court’s decision on these grounds.</p>
<p id="c0eb59df-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This chapter focuses instead on errors by the trial court, and the doctrinal walls that shield U.S. trial court decisions. It will answer three questions about the availability of review: <i>Who</i>—which persons can seek review of a trial court decision? <i>When</i>—at what moment may one appeal a trial court decision? And <i>how</i>—with what depth will an appellate court scrutinize an appealable decision?</p>
<p id="c0eb59e0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Understanding these doctrines has two virtues. It is obviously essential for any lawyer who wants to appeal a trial court decision. It is equally important for another reason: Understanding the barriers to appellate review helps one to comprehend that, as a practical matter, the trial court’s decision will likely be the <i>only</i> decision on most procedural and substantive matters. This practical autonomy of the trial court puts great weight on the trial judge—to make the right decision—and on the lawyers—to give the trial judge all the information needed to make the right decision.</p>

<p id="c0eb59e3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In theory, one could imagine appellate courts functioning as the supervisors of trial courts, automatically reviewing cases to assure both that the results are correct and that the trial judges are following appropriate procedures. Or one might imagine a judicial inspector general who would have the power and duty to bring to the attention of appellate courts instances in which either the process or the result of a trial court decision seems questionable. Administrative systems follow such models, and some civil law systems approximate them.</p>
<p id="c0eb59e4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The U.S. courts do not. Even a blatantly erroneous decision may be appealed only by a party to the lawsuit; a party, that is, who has not settled. A settlement agreement will invariably prevent further litigation of a claim. So, if a defendant grudgingly agrees to a settlement because he believes the trial court wrongly denied his motion to dismiss, he loses his right to appeal that decision by settling the case. Even more striking, a losing party who has not settled may nevertheless be unable to gain appellate reversal of a clearly erroneous trial court decision. Two doctrines create this result: those that allow appeals only by parties who have suffered an adverse outcome in the case, and those that deter appeals with various penalties.</p>

<p id="c0eb80fb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A hallmark of modern procedure is the ease with which parties can join multiple claims in a single lawsuit. This poses a problem for appellate review: If plaintiff wins on one claim but loses on others, may plaintiff appeal the unsuccessful claims? Conversely, if a defendant prevails on one of several defenses, may he appeal his loss on the others? Contemporary appellate review is result-oriented, so the answer to this question requires one to look at the relief sought by the party prevailing on one but not all claims or defenses. If the relief sought under the losing theories was identical to that awarded in the winning claim, no appeal will lie, even if the appellate court thinks the trial court erred. If, on the other hand, the rejected claim or defense would have entitled the appealing party to more or different relief—to a different judgment—then the party can appeal. One can describe the principle as the requirement of an “adverse” judgment, a judgment granting relief less than what one requested.</p>

She sues landlord for personal injuries, invoking two theories under which the landlord had a duty to repair the roof—a duty arising under the lease, and a duty arising under the municipal housing code. Both allow for compensatory damages, and the municipal housing code authorizes prevailing plaintiffs to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees.

Contract damages call for the plaintiff to recover the difference between the value of the car she received and a new one—$3,000 in this instance. Punitive damages are available for fraud, and are measured not by plaintiff’s loss but by the magnitude of the wrong committed by defendant. The court dismisses the plaintiff’s fraud claim, but awards plaintiff damages for breach of contract. May plaintiff appeal?</p></li>

<p id="c0eba817-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In large building projects, the owner or developer frequently requires that its main contractor take out an insurance policy to cover the possibility that the contractor will be unable to complete the project. If this happens, the policy provides funds so others can complete the project. In <i>Cunningham</i>, the contractor failed to complete the project, and Aetna, the insurer, stepped in. After the dust settled (so to speak) and the project was completed with Aetna’s money, Aetna tried to recover $32,000—the amount of its loss—from the contractor. At trial Aetna presented two claims: that the contractor/insured violated its contractual obligation to indemnify Aetna for these losses; and that, without regard to the policy terms, the contractor/insured had committed fraud in applying for the policy and that Aetna’s loss was traceable to that fraud. (Aetna did not seek punitive damages on the fraud claim.) The district court found for Aetna on the contract claim but ruled that the contractor had not committed fraud. Both Aetna and the contractor appealed; an issue on appeal was which party could raise which contentions of error on appeal. Note that (1) failed construction contractors often file for bankruptcy protection from their creditors and (2) under some conditions liabilities incurred as a result of fraud are not discharged in bankruptcy.]</p>
<p id="c0eba818-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the outset there is some doubt as to whether Aetna can appeal from the judgment which was in its favor in the amount prayed. If the relief granted was all to which Aetna was entitled, the mere fact that it was granted on one ground rather than on another would not make Aetna an aggrieved party on appeal. But amount is not the sole measure of the relief to which a party may be entitled. The judgment may have different qualities and legal consequences dependent on the claim on which it is based. At the beginning of the trial, Aetna’s counsel, in response to an inquiry from the court, frankly stated his reason for insisting on the tort claim for fraud and <span title="665" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-665">p. 665</span>deceit, “Because if we get a straight contract judgment it would be dischargeable in bankruptcy.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0eba819-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It would be premature for us to pass upon the effect of bankruptcy on a judgment on either claim, or upon whether the finding that Cunningham’s representations were not fraudulent would be <i>res judicata</i> as to the operation of a discharge in bankruptcy. It is enough at this time for us to hold that, if Aetna was denied judgment of the quality to which it laid claim [i.e., the fraud claim], it is a party aggrieved on appeal. . . . </p>
<p id="c0eba81a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law is fashioned to work substantial justice in real transactions. We hold, therefore, that when, as a practical matter, the denial of any one claim results in the plaintiff not getting the relief to which it claims to be entitled, whether in the amount or in the quality of the judgment, it has a right to be heard on appeal. . . . </p>

</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0eba821-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In cases with counterclaims and cross-appeals, a party can prevail and suffer an adverse judgment in the same case. Imagine that Retailer sues Customer for nonpayment of a bill. Customer counterclaims for breach of warranty on the product involved. The trial court enters judgment for Retailer on its claim but also awards damages to Customer on its warranty claim. Customer appeals. On appeal, Retailer will argue the correctness of the trial court’s rulings on the claim of nonpayment. Retailer may also <i>cross-appeal</i>, arguing that the court erred in upholding the counterclaim for breach of warranty against it. As to that part of the case Retailer has suffered an adverse judgment.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0eba822-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another aspect of the requirement that the judgment be adverse is the doctrine of mootness, which holds that one may not appeal from a judgment when circumstances have changed in such a way that relief is no longer possible. The doctrine affects not only appeals but also the justiciability of the suit because mootness undercuts the existence of an actual case or controversy required by Article III of the Constitution. There are, however, numerous exceptions to the doctrine.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0eba823-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="666" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-666">p. 666</span>One of the most important exceptions is the case in which the plaintiff’s claim has been satisfied despite an adverse ruling by the lower court, but the question raised by the claim is likely to recur, and application of the mootness doctrine would effectively prevent the question from ever receiving appellate review. In Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393 (1975), for example, the plaintiff challenged Iowa’s one-year residency requirement for obtaining a divorce. The lower court upheld the requirement, but during the litigation the year passed and the plaintiff became able to obtain her divorce. The Supreme Court nevertheless refused to dismiss the case as moot, reasoning that other plaintiffs would find themselves in the same situation.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ebcf34-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mootness can also result from settlement. Suppose a case goes to judgment in the trial court and the loser appeals. While the appeal is pending, the parties settle. That settlement moots the appeal and, on being notified, the appellate court will dismiss the case without deciding the issues raised by the appeal.</p></li>

<p id="c0ebcf37-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider the framework of <i>Aetna v. Cunningham</i> (supra page 664) once more. Suppose that at trial the insurer’s evidence of fraud consisted not of misstatements by the contractor but of his failure to disclose the extent of his debts. Some jurisdictions recognize nondisclosure as a form of fraud. Suppose the contractor’s lawyer does not object to the evidence. If the trial court enters judgment against the contractor on the fraud count, may the contractor on appeal argue that nondisclosure was not sufficient to show fraud?</p>
<p id="c0ebcf38-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Generally not: A party must present to the trial court the contentions on which it wants rulings. Failure to do so results in waiver. A century ago the party had not only to raise the contention below but then to make a formal “exception” to the trial court ruling in order to preserve the issue for appeal. Rule 46 did away with the need for exceptions; the “party need only state the action that it wants the court to take or objects to, along with the grounds.  . . . ” The abolition of the formal requirement did not, however, abolish the doctrine of waiver.</p>
<p id="c0ebcf39-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts try to walk a narrow path here. On one hand, they want to avoid hypertechnicality and preserve the ability to do justice. On the other hand, they want to prevent a litigant from “sandbagging” opposing counsel or the trial court—by vaguely expressing opposition to a trial court’s decision, then proceeding through trial, hoping to win on the merits but thinking it has “banked” an appellate reversal in case of a loss. The doctrine of waiver on appeal prevents such a strategy. Think about how it should apply in the circumstances in the problems below.</p>

Cunningham</i> the defendant filed a 12(b)(6) motion challenging the complaint on the grounds that it alleged only failure to disclose, not affirmative misrepresentation. Having lost the 12(b)(6) motion, does the defendant also have to object to the plaintiff’s evidence at trial to preserve the point for appeal? Yes, at least to be on the safe side:</p>

In the present case the points asserted by motion were not again presented by any request for instructions, or by any effort to have the Court direct the jury to pass separately upon the question of whether the actions should be merely abated or determined upon its merits. Therefore, since the point was not properly urged and presented, there is no occasion to determine the validity of the. . . . defense. Likewise, as to the objections now urged to the charge (which in some portions apparently gave effect to this defense) since no objection was presented to the trial Court, the appellant cannot here properly complain of the alleged erroneous instruction. We cannot accept the contention that the assertion of the objection by motion to strik[e] properly presented and preserved the point throughout the proceedings of the subsequent trial.</p>

Suppose that the insurer contended that the insured’s fraud had consisted of failure to disclose certain information. Further suppose there was a question of whether the law of Connecticut (the insurer’s base) or Texas (the insured’s) applied. At trial, insurer argued that Connecticut law applied and that it recognized nondisclosure as fraud. Insurer wins a judgment on the fraud claim and the defendant appeals. On appeal, appellee insurer wants to argue in support of the judgment that Texas also recognizes nondisclosure as fraud so that an appellate ruling that Texas law applies would not require reversal of the judgment.

In other words, the appellee may not attack the decree with a view either to enlarging his own rights thereunder or of lessening the rights of his adversary, whether what he seeks is to correct an error or to supplement the decree with respect to a matter dealt with below. But it is likewise settled that the appellee may, without taking a cross-appeal, urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record, although his argument may involve an attack upon the reasoning of the lower court or an insistence upon a matter overlooked or ignored by it.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0ebf65e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts are not always this hard-nosed, however, and will sometimes permit such late-maturing grounds for appeal.

<li class=""><p id="c0ebf660-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The doctrine is most commonly applied in criminal cases, where the courts are thought to have a special duty to assure that defendants are not convicted unfairly. In that context, the Supreme Court has explained that the error in the trial court must not have been intentionally waived, must have been obvious, and must have affected substantial rights of the appellant. United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725 (1990).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ebf661-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before you conclude that this doctrine will save you from a failure to object, be warned that courts in civil cases are inclined to apply the plain-error rule “sparingly and only in exceptional cases or under peculiar circumstances to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice.” Smith v. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 877 F.2d 1106 (1st Cir. 1989).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ec1d72-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plain-error rule tests how appellate courts balance the principle of fairness to the parties against the correctness of the result. To say that the failure to object is excused (because an error is “plain”) is to say that the appellate courts assume some degree of responsibility for assuring the correctness of the outcome, not just fairness to the parties.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ec1d73-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having virtually assaulted the student with the proposition that appellate courts will not consider arguments not made at trial, we should note a glaring exception: <i>Erie Railroad v. Tompkins</i>, supra page 259. In that landmark decision, neither party had raised the choice of law question, nor had the Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider it. The Court thus made its landmark decision on a basis not argued or briefed by either party. One can reconcile <i>Erie</i> with the preceding discussion: A court may decide on a basis not raised by the parties, but a party must consistently raise an issue he wants to argue. Nevertheless, one might think that the concept of fair notice that applies to the parties might also apply to the courts.</p></li>

<p id="c0ec1d77-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both legislatures and appellate courts take ambivalent stances toward appeal. We all want to correct erroneous outcomes, but appeals take time and money and we are just as eager to discourage ill-grounded appeals. In many respects the urge to discourage fruitless appeals mirrors the struggle over ungrounded complaints: Is there a way to discourage the unmeritorious appeals without burdening meritorious ones?</p>
<p id="c0ec1d78-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has never held that there is a constitutional right to appeal a civil case, so a jurisdiction could in theory either forbid civil appeals absolutely or, less dramatically, make all civil appeals a matter of discretion rather than of right. Most jurisdictions, though, grant the right to at least one appeal in civil cases; further appeal is often discretionary.</p>
<p id="c0ec1d79-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although legislatures permit appeals, they sometimes try to discourage them. The U.S. Supreme Court has explored the limits of such discouragement in several cases in which state statutes put special burdens on some appeals. In Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56 (1972), the Court invalidated a state statute that required tenants appealing an eviction judgment to post a bond twice as great as the rent expected to accrue during the appeal. By contrast, in Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co. v. Crenshaw, 486 U.S. 71 (1988), the Court rejected a challenge to a Mississippi statute that imposed a 15 percent penalty on an unsuccessful appeal of a judgment for money damages. The penalty was imposed regardless of the merits of the appeal so long as the appellate court affirmed the damages award without alteration. Bankers Life suffered a $1.6 million punitive damage judgment, which it unsuccessfully appealed, with the appellate court adding a $243,000 penalty to the judgment because the original award was affirmed. Bankers Life argued that the statute had denied it equal protection of the law “because it singles out appellants from money judgments, and because it penalizes all such appellants who are unsuccessful, regardless of the merits of their appeal.” 486 U.S. at 81. The Supreme Court rejected this contention in language that revealed its general stance toward appeals:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0ec1d7a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under this Court’s equal protection jurisprudence, Mississippi’s statute is “presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification. . . . is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.” The state interests assertedly served by the Mississippi statute were detailed by the Mississippi Supreme Court in Walters v. Inexco Oil Co., 440 So. 2d 268 (1983). The penalty statute. . . . “expresses the state’s interest in discouraging frivolous appeals. It likewise expresses a bona fide interest in providing a measure of compensation for the successful appellee, compensation for his having endured the slings and arrows of successful appellate litigation.” In a similar vein the statute protects the integrity of judgments by discouraging appellant-defendants from prolonging the litigation merely to “squeeze a favorable settlement out of an impecunious” appellee. Also, the penalty statute “tells the litigants that the trial itself is a momentous event, the <span title="671" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-671">p. 671</span>centerpiece of litigation, not just a first step weighing station en route to endless rehearings and reconsiderations.” Finally, in part because it serves these other goals, the penalty statute furthers the State’s interest in conserving judicial resources.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0ec1d7b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Id. at 81-82. The <i>Bankers Life</i> Court distinguished <i>Lindsey</i> on the grounds that the Oregon statute in <i>Lindsey</i> arbitrarily discriminated against tenants (because it applied only to them among all appellants) and was not needed to effectuate the state’s purpose of preserving the property at issue.</p>
<p id="c0ec1d7c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Lindsey</i> and <i>Bankers Life</i> involved “extra” appellate costs. What about ordinary costs that rest on all litigants? Can they ever be unconstitutional? In M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102 (1996), the indigent petitioner sought to appeal from a trial court order terminating her parental rights on the grounds she was unfit as a mother. To appeal the state court decision, M.L.B. would have had to pay filing and transcript fees of about $2,300. The state supreme court refused to waive the fees. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed, basing its decision on a combination of due process (“a family association so undeniably important is at stake”) and equal protection; the 6-3 majority held “that Mississippi may not withhold from M.L.B. a record of sufficient completeness to permit proper consideration of her claims.”</p>
<p id="c0ec1d7d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lest you think that appellate costs burden only the poor, consider Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 481 U.S. 1 (1987). Many states require appellants to post <i>supersedeas</i> bonds to prevent judgment winners from executing the trial court judgment immediately while the case is on appeal. These bonds, which allow appeal to proceed, are often posted by insurers in return for a premium that is a fraction of the bond amount. Texaco suffered a $10 billion jury verdict in a takeover fight with a business rival. Although it was at the time the fifth-largest corporation in the United States, Texaco lacked the funds to post such a bond or to pay the premium for an insurer to do so—and was consequently unable to appeal the verdict. It argued to the U.S. Supreme Court that the size of the <i>supersedeas</i> bond violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses; the Court rejected the case on jurisdictional grounds without reaching the constitutional claims. Read together, <i>Lindsey, Bankers Life</i>, <i>M.L.B.</i>, and <i>Texaco</i> suggest that some burden on appeals is constitutional, even when those burdens fall heavily on particular litigants.</p>
<p id="c0ec1d7e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should legal systems seek generally to discourage appeals by requiring, for example, that the loser pay the winner’s attorneys’ fees? Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (Fed. R. App. P.) 38 permits a court of appeals to award “just damages and single or double costs to the appellee” if the appellate court “determine[s] that an appeal is frivolous.” One finds occasional invocation of this Rule, but it is used far less frequently than is Rule 11, its analogue at the district court level. A quite different sort of sanction for meritless appeals that is increasingly used by state and federal appellate courts is the summary affirmance or unpublished decision. Such orders, which go under different names in different systems, often involve denial of the right to oral argument, a decision on the briefs and record alone, and either a one-word order (“affirmed”) or a short unpublished opinion. For an example, see <i>Haddle v. Garrison</i>, supra page 374. Some would argue that such “appeals” exist in name only.</p>

<p id="c0ec4491-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The single most significant doctrine of appellate procedure in the United States is one that purports to be only about the timing of appeal. Under 28 U.S.C. §1291, appeals can be brought only after there is a final decision by the district court (with some significant exceptions). Most, but not all, states follow a similar pattern. <i>Reise v. Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin</i>, supra page 51, shows an appellate court refusing to review the trial court’s discovery decision on this ground.</p>
<p id="c0ec4492-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The final judgment rule affects not just the timing of appeal but its availability. To see why, consider how modern procedure has altered the center of gravity in civil litigation. Once upon a time, most trial court decisions were made at trial. In such a system, decisions were promptly reviewable because the trial resulted in a judgment from which an appeal would lie. Modern procedure changes that pattern: Discovery and the pretrial process now dominate the procedural landscape. Many rulings entered during the pretrial stage do not immediately produce final judgments; they are “interlocutory.” An interlocutory decision cannot be appealed until there is a final judgment in the case, and many cases will never have final judgments because they settle. Under such circumstances, the final judgment rule does not just defer but eliminates appellate review.</p>
<p id="c0ec4493-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So to note is not to condemn. The unavailability of appeal may be a good thing: Appeals take time, and most are unsuccessful. The unavailability of appeal may merely make justice faster and cheaper. Alternatively, one can see it as empowering trial judges to be petty dictators who can be secure in the knowledge that most of their rulings will never reach appellate scrutiny.</p>
<p id="c0ec4494-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Any rule that has such effects will generate tensions and exceptions. This section explores the contours of the basic rule and some exceptions generated by the pressure to escape it.</p>

<p id="c0ec449a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A final decision “is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.” Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 233 (1945). That’s the easy part; the hard part is determining which decisions are “final.” Although at first glance the problem may seem to center on premature attempts at <span title="673" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-673">p. 673</span>appeal, which entail unnecessary cost and delay, the more serious problem is late appeals: There are cases in which litigants waited for a document labeled as a “final judgment” only to learn that earlier orders disposing of their claims were deemed to be a final judgment and that the time for appeal had run in the meantime.</p>

<p id="c0ec449d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 1291, which contains the final judgment rule as it applies to federal courts, has two functions: It defines the moment at which an appeal is proper; and it grants jurisdiction for the appellate courts to hear that appeal. The next case demonstrates the consequences that a wrong guess about the first function can have on the second. A bit of context may explain why this decision embarrassed the Court at least slightly. In the mid-1970s, the law regarding discrimination involving pregnancy was in flux. Some cases had ruled that it was a form of gender discrimination banned by civil rights legislation. Other cases had said that, although only women could become pregnant, discrimination on account of pregnancy was not gender discrimination. The Supreme Court had granted certiorari on several related cases to resolve the dispute—only to discover that it could not decide one of the cases on the merits.</p>

The District Court ruled in favor of respondents on the issue of petitioner’s liability under that Act, and petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. That court held that it had jurisdiction of petitioner’s appeal under 28 U.S.C. §1291, and proceeded to affirm on the merits the judgment of the District Court. We granted certiorari and heard argument on the merits. Though neither party has questioned the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to entertain the appeal, we are obligated to do so on our own motion if a question thereto exists.

Rule Civ. Proc. 56[(a)]. The District Court on January 9, 1974, finding no issues of material fact in dispute, entered an order to the effect that petitioner’s pregnancy-related policies violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It also ruled that Liberty Mutual’s hiring and promotion policies violated Title VII. Petitioner thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied by the District Court. Its order of February 20, 1974, denying the motion for reconsideration, contains the following concluding language:</p>

<p id="c0ec6bbd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is obvious from the District Court’s order that respondents, although having received a favorable ruling on the issue of petitioner’s liability to them, received none of the relief which they expressly prayed for in the portion of their complaint set forth above. They requested an injunction, but did not get one; they requested damages, but were not awarded any; they requested attorneys’ fees, but received none.</p>
<p id="c0ec6bbe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Counsel for respondents when questioned during oral argument in this Court suggested that at least the District Court’s order of February 20 amounted to a declaratory judgment on the issue of liability pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §2201. Had respondents sought only a declaratory judgment, and no other form of relief, we would of course have a different case. But even if we accept respondents’ contention that the District Court’s order was a declaratory judgment on the issue of liability, it nonetheless left unresolved respondents’ requests for an injunction, for compensatory and exemplary damages, and for attorneys’ fees. It finally disposed of none of respondents’ prayers for relief.</p>
<p id="c0ec6bbf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court and the Court of Appeals apparently took the view that because the District Court made the recital required by Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(b) that final judgment be entered on the issue of liability, and that there was no just reason for delay, the orders thereby became appealable as a final decision pursuant <span title="675" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-675">p. 675</span>to 28 U.S.C. §1291.

They prayed for several different types of relief in the event that they sustained the allegations of their complaint, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(3), but their complaint advanced a single legal theory which was applied to only one set of facts.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1031A_d543ff9f-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1031A_d543ff9f-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">4</a></span> Thus, despite the fact that the District Court undoubtedly made the findings required under the Rule had it been applicable, those findings do not in a case such as this make the order appealable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1291.</p>
<p id="c0ec92d5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn to consider whether the District Court’s order might have been appealed by petitioner to the Court of Appeals under any other theory. The order, viewed apart from its discussion of Rule 54(b), constitutes a grant of partial summary judgment limited to the issue of petitioner’s liability. Such judgments are by their term interlocutory, and where assessment of damages or awarding of other relief remains to be resolved have never been considered to be “final” within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. §1292. Thus the only possible authorization for an appeal from the District Court’s order would be pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §1292.</p>
<p id="c0ec92d6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the District Court had granted injunctive relief but had not ruled on respondents’ other requests for relief, this interlocutory order would have been appealable under §1292(a)(1).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10328_d543ff9f-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10328_d543ff9f-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">5</a></span> As noted above, the court did not issue an injunction.

But even if this would have allowed respondents to then obtain review in the Court of Appeals, there was no denial of any injunction sought by Petitioner and it could not avail itself of that grant of jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="c0ec92d9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor was this order appealable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1292(b).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10339_d543ff9f-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10339_d543ff9f-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">6</a></span> Although the District Court’s findings made with a view to satisfying Rule 54(b) might be viewed as substantial compliance with the certification requirement of that section, there is no showing in this record that petitioner made application to the Court of Appeals within the 10 days therein specified. And that court’s holding that its jurisdiction was pursuant to §1291 makes it clear that it thought itself obliged to consider on the merits petitioner’s appeal. There can be no assurance that had the other requirements of §1292(b) been complied with, the Court of Appeals would have exercised its discretion to entertain the interlocutory appeal.</p>
<p id="c0ec92db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Were we to sustain the procedure followed here, we would condone a practice whereby a district court in virtually any case before it might render an interlocutory decision on the question of liability of the defendant, and the defendant would thereupon be permitted to appeal to the court of appeals without satisfying any of the requirements that Congress carefully set forth. We believe that Congress, in enacting present §§1291 and 1292 of Title 28, has been well aware of the dangers of an overly rigid insistence upon a “final decision” for appeal in every case, and has in those sections made ample provision for appeal of orders which are not “final” so as to alleviate any possible hardship. We would twist the fabric of the statute more than it will bear if we were to agree that the District Court’s order of February 20, 1974, was appealable to the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p id="c0ec92dc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss the petitioner’s appeal. It is so ordered.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0ecb9f5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For federal courts, the final judgment rule is jurisdictional; if there has not been a final judgment, the appellate court does not have jurisdiction to hear the case. This has been so since the Judiciary Act of 1789. Note, however, that the final judgment rule does not always apply—as you will learn when you encounter the “practical finality” doctrine, infra page 682.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ecb9f6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, some states allow interlocutory appeals in a wide range of situations. New York, for example, has formally rejected the final judgment rule. Its procedural code makes appealable by right “any final or interlocutory judgment” and further specifies a series of pretrial orders from which a losing party may take immediate appeal, including such broad categories as any order that “involves some part of the merits or. . . . affects a substantial right.” N.Y. Civ. Prac. L. &amp; R. 5701. Other states may, less formally, have created substantial loopholes by manipulating the availability of the extraordinary writs of mandamus and prohibition (see infra page 689).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ecb9f7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A salient characteristic of modern procedure is its allowance of multiple claims and parties. How has the final judgment rule adapted to this reality?</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0ecb9f8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One option would have been to allow no appeal until after all claims of all parties had been resolved. As noted in <i>Wetzel</i>, Rule 54(b) rejects this solution: “[T]he court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.” If such a judgment is entered, it becomes appealable.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ecb9f9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 54(b) requires that the “court expressly determine[s] that there is no just reason for delay” in making the decision immediately appealable. Suppose a case involving several plaintiffs against a single defendant. The court grants summary judgment against one of the plaintiffs. Or imagine a case involving one plaintiff against several defendants in which the court grants summary judgment in favor of one defendant. If the court so certifies under Rule 54(b), the loser can immediately appeal. What should guide the judge’s <span title="678" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-678">p. 678</span>discretion in deciding whether to issue a Rule 54(b) certification in such a case? There are efficiency considerations: If the potential appeal contains an issue that persists in the remaining claims, an appellate decision may clarify it before trial. Or a judge might decide to allow an interlocutory appeal on precisely the opposite grounds—that the issues involved as to the loser are entirely different from those for the remaining case—such that a decision won’t complicate the case for the remaining parties.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ecb9fa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, suppose a more ordinary case, in which a plaintiff has several claims against a defendant—perhaps a claim of copyright infringement and several state law contract claims. The defendant wins partial summary judgment on the copyright claim, which the plaintiff would like to appeal. But the judge does not certify that claim under Rule 54(b). Can the plaintiff voluntarily dismiss the remaining claims and thus create an appealable final judgment? Held: Yes, absent evidence of intent to manipulate appellate jurisdiction. James v. Price Stern Sloan, Inc., 283 F.3d 1064 (9th Cir. 2002). Consider how a court might assess whether there was an intent to manipulate appellate jurisdiction.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0ecb9fb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cases in which the trial judge is particularly likely to be wrong also pose an exception to the final judgment rule. Under 28 U.S.C. §1292(b), discussed in <i>Wetzel</i>, in <i>Mosley</i>, infra page 788, and at further length later in this section, the trial judge may certify (among other things) that her order involves “a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion” and “that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.” If the Court of Appeals agrees, it may hear an appeal from a non-final order.</p></li>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0ece10e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">WHY THE FINAL JUDGMENT RULE?</p></div>
<p id="c0ece10f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The basic argument for the final judgment rule involves a cost-benefit calculation. The costs of allowing interlocutory appeals are the costs of an unnecessary extra appeal if the trial judge turns out to have been correct. The costs of not allowing interlocutory appeals are those of an unnecessary or an unnecessarily long trial if the trial judge turns out to have been wrong.</p>
<p id="c0ece110-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Advocates of the final judgment rule would argue that the costs of interlocutory appeal are too high. If we assume that the costs of an unnecessary extra appeal are approximately the same as the costs of an unnecessary or unnecessarily long trial, the overall costs are proportional to the number of times the trial judge is right versus the number of times he is wrong. If trial judges are right more often <span title="679" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-679">p. 679</span>than they are wrong (measured by eventual reversal when appeal finally occurs), then the general policy should disfavor interlocutory appeals. In fact, trial judges are reversed far less often than they are affirmed (the federal courts report a reversal rate of between 10-20 percent), and many decisions are not even appealed. From this perspective, the general policy seems wise.</p>
<p id="c0ece111-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those opposed to the final judgment rule might argue that some of these premises are wrong. First, trials, which require elaborate pretrial preparation, witnesses, and sometimes juries, will generally be more expensive than appeals. Second, in some undetermined number of cases, parties will abandon meritorious positions (that is, settle the case) because they cannot afford to wait for vindication on appeal. To point to the absence of appeal in such cases as evidence of a satisfactory trial is to ignore the realities of litigation.</p>
<p id="c0ece112-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beyond that, one can make a historical argument. Whatever one thinks of the original merits of the final judgment rule, its effect has changed dramatically with the advent of modern procedure. Before the Federal Rules (and equivalent state systems’ rules of procedure) came into effect, there were essentially two stages in litigation, pleading and trial. If a case ended at the pleading stage, appeal was immediately available. If it didn’t, trial would follow shortly, after which appeal was again available to the loser. Modern procedure, with its emphasis on discovery and a multistage pretrial process, adopts many of the main features of equity practice. Unlike the common law, equity permitted appeal from all interlocutory rulings. By adopting equity procedure but retaining the common law rule for appealability, modern process has delegated substantial amounts of unreviewable power to the trial court. That might be a good idea, but it has to be defended in light of the current structure of litigation.</p>

<div class="epub-heading  left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0ece114-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">b.&nbsp;<i>Defining the Moment of Judgment</i></p></div>
<p id="c0ece115-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even when one is alert to the dire jurisdictional consequences of failure to heed the final judgment rule, it is not always easy to locate the precise point at which a judgment becomes final—or even, for that matter, to identify the judicial act that constitutes a judgment. One difficulty is that the judge’s belief that she is entering a judgment can be second-guessed by the appellate court. Recall that in <i>Wetzel</i> both parties understandably thought that the judge’s announcement that “final judgment be entered” meant what it said, but the Supreme Court ruled otherwise.</p>
<p id="c0ece116-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider the matter from the perspective of a party wishing to appeal. The only step required to bring an appeal from a ruling of the district court is the timely filing of a notice of appeal with the clerk of the district court. Fed. R. App. P. 3(a)(1). That notice must be filed within the time allowed by Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A)—30 days for the typical appeal; 60 days for an appeal involving the United States. The issue of timing is critical because, as you have seen, the courts of appeals have repeatedly held that the time limits are jurisdictional—that is, that the court of appeals has no jurisdiction to hear the appeal if the notice of appeal is filed too late. Two provisions of 28 U.S.C. §2107 and the appellate rules slightly alleviate the problem of late filings. Section 2107 and Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6) empower the district court to extend this time for a party who did not receive notice of the entry of the judgment in question if no prejudice to other parties results. Section 2107 <span title="680" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-680">p. 680</span>and Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5) also allow the district court to extend the time for filing the notice of appeal up to 30 days on a showing of “excusable neglect or good cause.”</p>
<p id="c0ece117-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An equally serious problem confronts litigants who file their appeals <i>too early</i>. As we have seen, under 28 U.S.C. §1291, appeals lie “from all final decisions of the district courts.” By negative implication appeals do not lie from decisions of the district courts that are not final. In the distinction lies what the comments to Fed. R. App. P. 4 term “a trap for an unsuspecting litigant.” Before the Rule was amended, the trap was sprung if the appellant filed a notice of appeal after the judgment but while a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law or new trial was pending. Until these motions are decided, the final outcome—and judgment—in the case has not occurred. A number of unfortunate would-be appellants discovered this point in sorrow-producing ways. The amended rule, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(B), alleviates the difficulty by providing that when a party seeks to appeal from an order that would be final but for the interposition of one of these common post-trial motions, the appeal is held in abeyance until the disposition of these motions, at which point it becomes effective, thus preserving the jurisdiction of the court of appeals.</p>
<p id="c0ece118-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even with these provisions, timing remains critical, and rulemakers have therefore tried to make the moment of judgment extremely clear. Rule 58 requires that “[e]very judgment and amended judgment must be set out in a separate document. . . . ” In United States v. Indrelunas, 411 U.S. 216 (1973), the Court said that the separate-document requirement must be “mechanically applied.” The problem is that the separate document rule applies not to litigants but to court clerks and judges. These officials don’t always do what the Rules require, and when they fail, the litigants, not the officials, suffer the consequences. As the Rules Advisory Committee noted in 2002, “This simple separate document requirement has been ignored in many cases. . . . [with the result that] there have been many and horridly confused problems under Appellate Rule 4(a).” The current version of Rule 58 tries to set guidelines for some of the worst problems.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0ed0830-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>FirsTier</i> opinion evinces a certain amount of nervousness about the implications of its holding:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0ed0831-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not to say that [Fed.] Rule [App. P.] 4(a)(2) permits a notice of appeal from a clearly interlocutory decision—such as a discovery ruling or a sanction order under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure—to serve as a notice of appeal from the final judgment. A belief that such a decision is a final judgment would <i>not</i> be reasonable.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0ed0833-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It appears that the rule now is that a premature notice of appeal is saved by Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2) if the appellant reasonably believed that what the judge had issued was a final order. Is that a workable standard?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ed0834-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many statutes and a number of contracts now have fee-shifting provisions attached to them (see supra pages 349-57). Rule 54(d)(2) establishes a procedure for claiming and proving such fees. Suppose a judgment on the merits of the case has been entered, but there is a pending motion for attorney’s fees; can the losing party appeal the case? Or does the pendency of the fees motion mean that the judgment is not yet final? (Note that, in almost all cases, the answer matters because most fee disputes will take longer to resolve than the 30 days in which Fed. R. App. P. 4(a) requires that a notice of appeal must be filed.) In a pair of cases the U.S. Supreme Court has answered that question: “Whether the claim for attorney’s fees is based on a statute, a contract, or both, the pendency of a ruling on an award for fees and costs does not prevent, as a general rule, the merits judgment from becoming final for purposes of appeal.” Ray Haluch Gravel Co. v. Central Pension Fund, 134 S. Ct. 773 (2014). The consequence in the cited case was that the appellant, who had waited to appeal until the ruling on fees was entered, was far too late, and the appellate court therefore lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</p></li>

<p id="c0ed0837-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The adoption of the Federal Rules—and state codes that tracked the Rules’ innovations—greatly increased the importance of the stage between pleading and trial, in which substantial numbers of important but non-final rulings would occur. That circumstance placed substantial pressure on legislatures and courts to carve out appropriate exceptions to the final judgment rule. The efforts to define exceptions without abandoning the rule have not been easy. We survey the major exceptions below, starting with the one that has caused the greatest difficulty.</p>

<p id="c0ed2e4f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We granted certiorari to consider whether an interlocutory order of a United States District Court denying a defendant’s motion to dismiss a damages action on the basis of a contractual forum-selection clause is immediately appealable under 28 U.S.C. §1291 as a collateral final order. We hold that it is not.</p>

<p id="c0ed2e51-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The individual respondents were, or represent the estates of persons who were, passengers aboard the cruise ship Achille Lauro when it was hijacked by terrorists in the Mediterranean in October 1985. Petitioner Lauro Lines s.r.l., an Italian company, owns the Achille Lauro. Respondents filed suits against Lauro Lines in the District Court for the Southern District of New York to recover damages for injuries sustained as a result of the hijacking, and for the wrongful death of passenger Leon Klinghoffer. Lauro Lines moved before trial to dismiss the actions, citing the forum-selection clause printed on each passenger ticket. This clause purported to obligate the passenger to institute any suit arising in connection with the contract in Naples, Italy, and to renounce the right to sue elsewhere.</p>
<p id="c0ed2e52-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court denied petitioner’s motions to dismiss, holding that the ticket as a whole did not give reasonable notice to passengers that they were waiving the opportunity to sue in a domestic forum. Without moving for certification for immediate appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1292(b), Lauro Lines sought to appeal the District Court’s orders. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed petitioner’s appeal on the ground that the District Court’s orders denying petitioner’s motions to dismiss were interlocutory and not appealable under §1291. The court held that the orders did not fall within the exception to the rule of nonappealability carved out for collateral final orders in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949). We granted certiorari to resolve a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals. We now affirm.</p>

<p id="c0ed2e54-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Title 28 U.S.C. §1291 provides for appeal to the courts of appeals only from “final decisions of the district courts of the United States.” For purposes of §1291, a final judgment is generally regarded as “a decision by the District Court that ’ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.’” Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 521 (1988), quoting Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 233 (1945). An order denying a motion to dismiss a civil action on the ground that a contractual forum-selection clause requires that such suit be brought in another jurisdiction is not a decision on the merits that ends the litigation. On the contrary, such an order “ensures that litigation will continue in the District Court.” <span title="683" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-683">p. 683</span>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U.S. 271, 275 (1988). Section 1291 thus permits an appeal only if an order denying a motion to dismiss based upon a forum-selection clause falls within the “narrow exception to the normal application of the final judgment rule [that] has come to be known as the collateral order doctrine.” Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 798 (1989). That exception is for a “small class” of prejudgment orders that “finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, [and that are] too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.” <i>Cohen</i>, supra, at 546. We have held that to fall within the <i>Cohen</i> exception, an order must satisfy at least three conditions: “It must ’conclusively determine the disputed question,’ ’resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,’ and ’be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.’” Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472 U.S. 424, 431 (1985), quoting Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 468 (1978). For present purposes, we need not decide whether an order denying a dismissal motion based upon a contractual forum-selection clause conclusively determines a disputed issue, or whether it resolves an important issue that is independent of the merits of the action, for the District Court’s orders fail to satisfy the third requirement of the collateral order test.</p>
<p id="c0ed2e55-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recently reiterated the “general rule” that an order is “effectively unreviewable” only “where the order at issue involves ’an asserted right the legal and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial.’” <i>Midland Asphalt Corp</i>., quoting United States v. MacDonald, 435 U.S. 850, 860 (1978). If it is eventually decided that the District Court erred in allowing trial in this case to take place in New York, petitioner will have been put to unnecessary trouble and expense, and the value of its contractual right to an Italian forum will have been diminished. It is always true, however, that “there is value. . . . in triumphing before trial, rather than after it,” <i>MacDonald</i>, supra, at 860, n.7, and this Court has declined to find the costs associated with unnecessary litigation to be enough to warrant allowing the immediate appeal of a pretrial order. See <i>Richardson-Merrell Inc.</i>, supra, at 436 (“the possibility that a ruling may be erroneous and may impose additional litigation expense is not sufficient to set aside the finality requirement imposed by Congress” in §1291). Instead, we have insisted that the right asserted be one that is essentially destroyed if its vindication must be postponed until trial is completed.</p>
<p id="c0ed2e56-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have thus held in cases involving criminal prosecutions that the deprivation of a right not to be tried is effectively unreviewable after final judgment and is immediately appealable. Similarly, in civil cases, we have held that the denial of a motion to dismiss based upon a claim of absolute immunity from suit is immediately appealable prior to final judgment, “for the essence of absolute immunity is its possessor’s entitlement not to have to answer for his conduct in a civil damages action.” Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 525 (1985). And claims of qualified immunity may be pursued by immediate appeal, because qualified immunity too “is an immunity from suit.” On the other hand, we have declined to hold the collateral order doctrine applicable where a district court has denied a claim, not that the defendant has a right not to be sued at all, but that the suit against the defendant is not properly before <span title="684" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-684">p. 684</span>the particular court because it lacks jurisdiction. In Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.S. 517 (1988), a civil defendant moved for dismissal on the ground that he had been immune from service of process because his presence in the United States had been compelled by extradition to face criminal charges. We noted that, after <i>Mitchell</i>, “[t]he critical question. . . . is whether ’the essence’ of the claimed right is a right not to stand trial,” 486 U.S., at 524, and held that the immunity from service of process defendant asserted did not amount to an immunity from suit—even though service was essential to the trial court’s jurisdiction over the defendant.</p>
<p id="c0ed2e57-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lauro Lines argues here that its contractual forum-selection clause provided it with a right to trial before a tribunal in Italy, and with a concomitant right not to be sued anywhere else. This “right not to be haled for trial before tribunals outside the agreed forum,” petitioner claims, cannot effectively be vindicated by appeal after trial in an improper forum. There is no obviously correct way to characterize the right embodied in petitioner’s forum-selection provision: “all litigants who have a meritorious pretrial claim for dismissal can reasonably claim a right not to stand trial.” <i>Van Cauwenberghe</i>. The right appears most like that to be free from trial if it is characterized—as by petitioner—as a right not to be sued at all except in a Neapolitan forum. It appears less like a right not to be subjected to suit if characterized—as by the Court of Appeals—as “a right to have the binding adjudication of claims occur in a certain forum.” Even assuming that the former characterization is proper, however, petitioner is obviously not entitled under the forum-selection clause of its contract to avoid suit altogether, and an entitlement to avoid suit is different in kind from an entitlement to be sued only in a particular forum. Petitioner’s claim that it may be sued only in Naples, while not perfectly secured by appeal after final judgment, is adequately vindicable at that stage—surely as effectively vindicable as a claim that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant—and hence does not fall within the third prong of the collateral order doctrine.</p>
<p id="c0ed5568-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner argues that there is a strong federal policy favoring the enforcement of foreign forum-selection clauses, citing The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1 (1972), and that “the essential concomitant of this strong federal policy. . . . is the right of immediate appellate review of district court orders denying their enforcement.” A policy favoring enforcement of forum-selection clauses, however, would go to the merits of petitioner’s claim that its ticket-agreement requires that any suit be filed in Italy and that the agreement should be enforced by the federal courts. Immediate appealability of a prejudgment order denying enforcement, insofar as it depends upon satisfaction of the third prong of the collateral order test, turns on the precise contours of the right asserted, and not upon the likelihood of eventual success on the merits. The Court of Appeals properly dismissed petitioner’s appeal, and its judgment is affirmed.</p>

<p id="c0ed556a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I join the opinion of the Court, and write separately only to make express what seems to me implicit in its analysis.</p>
<p id="c0ed556b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reason we say that the right not to be sued elsewhere than in Naples is “adequately vindicable,” by merely reversing any judgment obtained in violation of it is, quite simply, that the law does not deem the right important enough to be vindicated by, as it were, an injunction against its violation obtained through interlocutory appeal. The importance of the right asserted has always been a significant part of our <span title="685" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-685">p. 685</span>collateral order doctrine. When first formulating that doctrine in <i>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp</i>. we said that it permits interlocutory appeal of final determinations of claims that are not only “separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action,” but also, we immediately added, “<i>too important</i> to be denied review” (emphasis added). Our later cases have retained that significant requirement. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ed556c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While it is true, therefore, that the “right not to be sued elsewhere than in Naples” is not fully vindicated—indeed, to be utterly frank, is positively destroyed—by permitting the trial to occur and reversing its outcome, that is vindication enough because the right is not sufficiently important to overcome the policies militating against interlocutory appeals. We have made that judgment when the right not to be tried in a particular court has been created through jurisdictional limitations established by Congress or by international treaty. The same judgment applies—if anything, a fortiori—when the right has been created by private agreement.</p>

<p id="c0ed556f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cruise line spent a good deal of money trying to get the appellate courts to treat this order as a final judgment—only to find out that it had spent the money in vain. A competent appellate lawyer could have told the appellant that this was a very long shot, given the existing law. Why did the appellant nevertheless think it was a shot worth taking? Without knowing for sure, we offer two speculations. First, if this case ends like most, it will settle—in which case no appeal is possible. Second, the underlying events would make the cruise line extremely reluctant to try the case to a New York jury. The pirates had singled out Leon Klinghoffer, the deceased passenger, as a Jew, then shot him to death and pushed him in his wheelchair into the ocean. Klinghoffer was a New York native. The issue before the jury would be whether the cruise line had taken adequate security measures to prevent these acts. Does that explain why the appellant may have thought that the long odds of an appeal were nevertheless its best odds?</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0ed7c89-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difficulties of creating exceptions are equally obvious: How can one define a coherent set of cases that will be entitled to review before the final judgment?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ed7c8a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court in <i>Lauro Lines</i> held that the order was not appealable and therefore did not decide whether the forum selection clause was valid. That ruling will often have the same practical effect as holding the order appealable but affirming the trial court decision on the merits. In some cases it is difficult to overcome the sense that denials of review are made with at least an over-the-shoulder glance at the merits. Such a glance may be particularly important in a case like <i>Lauro Lines</i>. Such cases are very unlikely to go to trial, and a settlement will not be appealable. Thus, the interlocutory review of the court order is likely to be the only review. Might this be the point of Justice Scalia’s concurrence?</p>
<p id="c0ed7c8b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Concerns about “practical finality” often arise in cases concerning the official immunity defense for government officials. Government officials sued for violating the constitutional rights of citizens have a powerful defense: “official immunity"—both absolute and qualified, as <i>Lauro Lines</i> describes. These doctrines intend not only to shield them from liability but also to shield them from the obligation to stand trial—including the necessity to endure discovery. As <i>Lauro Lines</i> recognizes, the “right not to stand trial” can only be vindicated if immediate appeal lies from a trial court order that—erroneously—holds that official immunity does not apply. See Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731 (1982) (allowing immediate appeal of trial court’s refusal to dismiss claim against President of the United States on grounds of absolute official immunity); Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511 (1985) (allowing immediate appeal of trial court’s refusal to dismiss a suit against a former United States Attorney General on qualified immunity grounds). <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</i> in Chapter 6 is another case that was appealed up to the Supreme Court following the denial of a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds. (Note, however, that the Supreme Court’s opinion in <i>Iqbal</i> focused not on qualified immunity—the immediately appealable issue—but on pleading standards, which are not subject to collateral review.)</p>

<p id="c0edcac8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additional efforts to release some of the tension created by the final judgment rule are found in several statutes. The terms of 28 U.S.C. §1292(b) permit a district court to certify interlocutory appeals from non-final judgments. A district court judge wishing to create the possibility for such an interlocutory appeal must certify that the order “involves a controlling question of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion” and that “an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.” For the interlocutory appeal to occur, not only must the district court judge so certify, but the appellate court must agree.</p>
<p id="c0edcac9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute is infrequently used. A study at the close of the 1980s, a period when overall appeals increased dramatically, revealed that out of the 40,000+ federal appeals in an average year only about 300 were certified by district courts, and of those only about one-third, 100 cases, were accepted by the courts of appeals. Michael Solomine, <i>Revitalizing Interlocutory Appeals in the Federal Courts</i>, 58 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1165 (1990). Note that one of the cases you may soon read, <i>Mosley v. General Motors Corp.</i>, infra page 788, was one of those relatively few exceptions.</p>
<p id="c0edcaca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another approach appears in Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f). Acting under the authority granted by 28 U.S.C. §2072(c), which permits the Rules to define “when a ruling of a district court is final for purposes of appeal,” Rule 23(f) now provides: “A court of appeals may permit an appeal from an order granting or denying class-action certification under this rule if a petition for permission to appeal is filed with the circuit clerk within fourteen days after the order is entered.” The district court need not agree. Do you think §1292(b) should be amended in a similar fashion?</p>

<div class="epub-heading  left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0edcacc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">d.&nbsp;<i>Mandamus</i></p></div>
<p id="c0edcacd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A <i>writ of mandamus</i> is not quite an interlocutory appeal, but it has a similar function. A party seeking a writ of mandamus essentially brings suit in an appellate court against the trial judge in the case, seeking an order that that judge perform an act required by law. For example, in LaBuy v. Howes Leather, 352 U.S. 249 (1957), where the district court had declined to try an antitrust case, instead referring it to a special master, the defendants sought a writ of mandamus from the court of appeals, ordering the district court to try the case. The court of appeals issued the writ and the writ was upheld by the Supreme Court. The Seventh Circuit had previously expressed its displeasure with referral of such cases to masters, and the Supreme Court was even more emphatic in describing the district court’s action as an “abdication of the judicial function.” The difficulty with mandamus arises because it can become a tempting route for the avoidance of the rules against interlocutory appeals explored in the preceding material. To prevent this evasion of the final judgment rule, the availability of the writ must be limited, as courts regularly remind:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0edf1de-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The remedy of mandamus is a drastic one, to be invoked only in extraordinary situations. As we have observed, the writ “has traditionally been used in the federal courts only ’to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or <span title="690" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-690">p. 690</span>to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.’” And, while we have not limited the use of mandamus by an unduly narrow and technical understanding of what constitutes a matter of “jurisdiction,” the fact still remains that “only exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial ’usurpation of power’ will justify the invocation of this extraordinary remedy.”</p>
<p id="c0edf1df-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kerr v. United States District Court, 426 U.S. 394, 402 (1976).</p>
</div>
<p id="c0edf1e0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In spite of such limitations, one does find cases where appellate courts are prepared to issue writs of mandamus. One area in which mandamus seems freely available, with little discussion of the usual stated limitations, is that in which the trial judge has denied a jury trial. Thus, in Beacon Theatres v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500 (1959) (granting a writ of mandamus and ordering a jury trial in a case combining legal and equitable claims), the propriety of interlocutory appellate review was largely assumed. Another exception to the general stinginess of the courts in issuing the writ is to prevent the transfer of a case, under 28 U.S.C. §1404(a), out of the circuit. The rationale is that the statutory basis for the writ, 28 U.S.C. §1651, authorizes writs to be issued by courts “in aid of their respective jurisdictions.” Because a transfer out of the circuit would deprive the court of appeals of its eventual jurisdiction on appeal, the appellate court has jurisdiction to consider the propriety of such a transfer order. The Seventh Circuit has adopted an apparently unique use of mandamus. In seeking the recusal of judges under 28 U.S.C. §455(a) (on the broad ground that “impartiality might reasonably be questioned”), that Circuit requires parties to use mandamus rather than appeal. The Circuit’s theory is that in such broadly based recusal motions, an aggrieved party who waits to appeal until after trial will have great difficulty demonstrating an effect on his “substantial rights.” As you will see in the next section, only an effect on “substantial rights” can constitute reversible error; therefore, in order to create some avenue by which denial of a §455(a) motion can be reviewed, mandamus is available. However tortured the Seventh Circuit’s reasoning, the result makes sense: In most cases mandamus on these grounds will be sought early in the case, before time has been wasted on proceedings that must be set aside.</p>

United States District Court</i>, supra, the Supreme Court upheld the Ninth Circuit’s refusal to issue a writ of mandamus requiring the district court to vacate a discovery order that would have required the California prison system to turn over all of its personnel files. The defendant prison <span title="691" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-691">p. 691</span>system resisted on grounds that the files were covered by various privileges. The Supreme Court “upheld” the refusal of the writ in terms that came close to granting it:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0edf1e5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners ask in essence only that the District Court review the challenged documents in camera before passing on whether each one individually should or should not be disclosed.

<li class=""><p id="c0edf1e7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A similar approach was used in <i>Schlagenhauf v. Holder</i>, noted supra page 472. The principal issue in <i>Schlagenhauf</i> was whether the district court could order a series of mental and physical examinations of a defendant bus driver whose bus had collided with another vehicle that he later claimed he did not see. The Supreme Court ruled that, of the numerous examinations ordered by the district court, only the eye examination was justified. The court of appeals had refused to issue a writ of mandamus ordering the district court to rescind its order for the additional examinations. One would therefore expect the Supreme Court to remand to the court of appeals for it to issue the writ of mandamus. Instead, the Court remanded the case to the district court for proceedings consistent with its opinion. (The Court did not note that the mandamus action before it, being an original action in the court of appeals, could not be remanded to the district court and that the original action was still in the district court.)</p></li>

<p id="c0ee672a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We must deal at the outset with the Fourth Circuit’s suggestion that “close scrutiny of the record in this case [was] justified by the manner in which the opinion was prepared"—that is, by the District Court’s adoption of petitioner’s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>
<p id="c0ee672b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We too, have criticized courts for their verbatim adoption of findings of fact prepared by prevailing parties. . . . Nonetheless, our previous discussions of the subject suggest that even when the trial judge adopts the proposed findings verbatim, the findings are those of the court and may be reversed only if clearly erroneous. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ee8e3c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any event, the District Court in this case does not appear to have uncritically accepted findings prepared without judicial guidance. . . . </p>

<p id="c0ee8e3e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because a finding of intentional discrimination is a finding of fact, the standard governing appellate review. . . . is that set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a): “Findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0ee8e3f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the meaning of the phrase “clearly erroneous” is not immediately apparent, certain general principles. . . . may be derived from our cases. The foremost of these principles, as the Fourth Circuit itself recognized, is that a “finding is ’clearly erroneous’ when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.” United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948). . . . Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.</p>
<p id="c0ee8e40-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is so even when the district court’s findings do not rest on credibility determinations, but are based instead on physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts. To be sure, various Courts of Appeals have on occasion asserted the theory that an appellate court may exercise de novo review over findings not based on credibility determinations. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ee8e41-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rationale for deference to the original finder of fact is not limited to the superiority of the trial judge’s position to make determinations of credibility. The trial judge’s major role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise. Duplication of the trial judge’s efforts in the court of appeals would very likely contribute only negligibly to the accuracy of fact determination at a huge cost in diversion of judicial resources. . . . As the Court has stated in a different <span title="694" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-694">p. 694</span>context, the trial on the merits should be “the ’main event’. . . . rather than a ’tryout on the road.’” Wainwright v.

The District Court’s finding was based on essentially undisputed evidence regarding the respective backgrounds of petitioner and Mr. Kincaid and the duties. . . . of Recreation Director. The District Court, after considering the evidence, concluded that the position. . . . carried with it broad responsibilities for creating and managing a recreation program involving not only athletics, but also other activities for citizens of all ages and interests. The court determined that petitioner’s more varied educational and employment background and her extensive involvement in a variety of civic activities left her better qualified to implement such a rounded program. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ee8e44-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fourth Circuit, reading the same record, concluded that the basic duty of Recreation Director was to implement an athletic program. . . . Accordingly, it seemed evident to the Court of Appeals that Mr. Kincaid was in fact better qualified than [Ms. Anderson].</p>
<p id="c0ee8e45-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on our reading of the record, we cannot say that either interpretation of the facts is illogical or implausible. Each has support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record. . . . The question we must answer, however, is not whether the Fourth Circuit’s interpretation of the facts was clearly erroneous, but whether the District Court’s finding was clearly erroneous. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ee8e46-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Somewhat different concerns are raised by the Fourth Circuit’s treatment of the District Court’s finding that petitioner, alone among the applicants. . . . , was asked questions regarding her spouse’s feelings. . . . Here the error of the Court of Appeals was its failure to give due regard to the ability of the District Court to interpret and discern the credibility of oral testimony. . . . The Court of Appeals rested its rejection of the District Court’s finding. . . . on its own interpretation of testimony by Mrs. Boone. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ee8e47-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mrs. Boone’s testimony on this point, which is set forth in the margin,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1077F_d543ff9f-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1077F_d543ff9f-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">3</a></span> is certainly not free from ambiguity.

We therefore cannot agree that the judge’s conclusion that the remark was facetious was clearly erroneous. . . . </p>
<p id="c0eedc7a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fourth Circuit’s refusal to accept the District Court’s finding that the committee members were biased against hiring a woman was based to a large extent on its rejection of the finding that petitioner had been subjected to questioning that the other applicants were spared. Given that that finding was not clearly erroneous, the finding of bias cannot be termed erroneous. . . . </p>
<p id="c0eedc7b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our determination that the findings of the District Court regarding petitioner’s qualifications, the conduct of her interview, and the bias of the male committee members were not clearly erroneous leads us to conclude that the court’s finding that petitioner was discriminated against on account of her sex was also not clearly erroneous. . . . </p>
<p id="c0eedc7c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In so holding, we do not assert that our knowledge of what happened 10 years ago in Bessemer City is superior to that of the Court of Appeals; nor do we claim to have greater insight than the Court of Appeals into the state of mind of the men on the selection committee. . . . Even the trial judge, who has heard the witnesses directly. . . . cannot always be confident that he “knows” what happened. Often, he can only determine whether the plaintiff has succeeded in presenting an account of the facts that is more likely to be true than not. Our task—and the task of appellate tribunals generally—is more limited still: we must determine whether the trial judge’s conclusions are clearly erroneous. On the record before us, we cannot say that they are. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0ef0395-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s holding might rest on the empirical belief that the trial judge is more likely than an appellate court to be correct in his judgments about which witnesses are telling the truth. If so, then the holding could be challenged by a showing that people in general, even judges, are in fact rather bad at detecting lies, even when they see the witness face to face. There is some empirical evidence that many people lack the capacity to detect untruth. Indeed, that same evidence suggests that people are <i>better</i> at detecting lies when they read a transcript than when they hear and see the witnesses. Guy Wellborn, <i>Demeanor</i>, 76 Cornell L. Rev. 1075 (1991) (reviewing a substantial body of essentially unanimous social science literature). If the clearly erroneous rule rests on such an empirical belief, it is itself clearly erroneous.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ef0396-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, the holding may have a different justification. Under Rule-driven procedure, cases that get to trial will have evidence supporting both sides; otherwise summary judgment would have occurred. So in such cases a rational trier of fact could come down on either side. Notwithstanding this uncertainty, a judgment has to be rendered. Precisely because of this uncertainty, it makes sense to adopt the view of the first hearer of the case unless there is powerful reason for thinking him wrong. Perhaps that is what the “clearly erroneous” rule is about.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ef0397-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 52(a)(6) now codifies one of <i>Anderson</i>’s points: “Findings of fact, <i>whether based on oral or other evidence</i>, must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.” (Emphasis added.)</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ef2aa8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many decisions are up to the sound discretion of the trial judge: Think of how many sections of the Rules say “may” rather than “must.” Appellate courts can review such decisions for abuse of discretion. As in <i>Anderson</i>’s insistence that factual findings be reversed only if clearly erroneous, the Supreme Court has expressed its impatience with appellate courts that “cheat” on the abuse-of-discretion standard by applying it too stringently. In General Electric v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136 (1997), a trial court had refused to allow some expert witnesses to testify. Such decisions are within the court’s discretion. The Eleventh Circuit reversed, citing a generalized preference for admissibility, and conceding that it was applying a particularly stringent standard of review. The Supreme Court reversed, ordering that the usual abuse-of-discretion standard be applied.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ef2aa9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a jury rather than a judge has found the fact in question, the principle of <i>Anderson</i>, or even a more stringent standard, may be constitutionally required. The “reexamination clause” of the Seventh Amendment provides that “no fact, tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of common law.” The Supreme Court has said that this clause permits trial court scrutiny of jury verdicts via Rule 50 and Rule 59 motions. The Court has also suggested, however, that the same reexamination <span title="697" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-697">p. 697</span>by an appellate court, because it has not been historically sanctioned, is at least doubtful. Does this suggest that jury verdicts get even more insulation than do judges’ factual findings?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ef2aaa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In one area the Court has not only permitted but required searching appellate review of facts and their application to law: punitive damage awards. In a pair of cases, the Supreme Court held that due process requires (a) that a state or federal appellate court must review a jury award of punitive damages, Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg, 512 U.S. 415 (1994); and (b) that the appellate review must be de novo, Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., 532 U.S. 424 (2001), thus stripping both jury and trial judge of the deference granted to such fact-finding and law-application.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ef2aab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Anderson</i> deals with one side of the law-fact distinction, holding that findings of fact are entitled to a deferential standard of review. The other side of that distinction is equally important: the proposition that trial court conclusions of law are not entitled to any deference. What does it tell us about the function of appellate review that a trial court may be “a little wrong” about facts, but not about law?</p></li>

<p id="c0ef2aae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if an appellate court applying the appropriate standard of review determines that the trial court committed error, it will not necessarily reverse. Federal courts are forbidden to reverse for “errors or defects that do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.” 28 U.S.C. §2111. This statute was enacted to reverse the so-called Exchequer Rule,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108B2_d543ff9f-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N108B2_d543ff9f-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*1</a></span> which had presumed that any error was harmful and required reversal. As a consequence of §2111, a court must, after concluding there was error, also decide whether that error was harmful.</p>
<p id="c0ef2ab0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts typically do so by speculating about the likely outcome of the case in the absence of the error; consider whether the next case correctly applies the principle.</p>

<p id="c0ef51c6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Joseph S. Van Zee sued Marilyn Hanson under 42 U.S.C. §1983, alleging that she violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights by disclosing his juvenile records to an Army recruiter. The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. This court affirms.</p>
<p id="c0ef51c7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Van Zee enlisted in the Army in early 2008. In June, his recruiter advised him that he could begin basic training after completion of a background check. Van Zee <span title="698" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-698">p. 698</span>then executed two blank release forms: one for law enforcement records, the other for probation officer and court records. The Army recruiter sent these forms to law enforcement and court agencies where Van Zee had resided, including to the Court Services Office of the Sixth Judicial District of South Dakota. The Chief Court Services Officer responded on July 2 that under South Dakota Law, Van Zee’s juvenile records could not be disclosed. On July 9, the recruiter contacted Hanson, Clerk of Courts for Hyde County, South Dakota, requesting Van Zee’s juvenile records. After Hanson disclosed Van Zee’s juvenile records, the recruiter notified him that his enlistment was canceled.</p>
<p id="c0ef51c8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court ruled that Van Zee did not state a claim under 42 U.S.C. §1983 because Hanson’s actions did not violate his right of privacy. This court reviews de novo the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, granting all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.</p>
<p id="c0ef51c9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To state a claim under §1983, a plaintiff must allege (1) that the defendant acted under color of state law, and (2) that the alleged conduct deprived the plaintiff of a constitutionally protected federal right.</p>
<p id="c0ef51ca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Van Zee claims that Hanson’s conduct violated his right of privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment. “[T]o violate the constitutional right of privacy the information disclosed must be either a shocking degradation or an egregious humiliatio. . . . , or a flagrant bre[a]ch of a pledge of confidentiality which was instrumental in obtaining the personal information.” Cooksey v. Boyer, 289 F.3d 513, 516 (8th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation omitted). “To determine whether a particular disclosure satisfies this exacting standard, we must examine the nature of the material. . . . to assess whether the person had a legitimate expectation that the information would remain confidential while in the state’s possession.” Eagle v. Morgan, 88 F.3d 620, 625 (8th Cir. 1996). The district court concluded that Van Zee lacked a legitimate expectation of privacy in his juvenile records due to his signed release forms, and that Hanson’s disclosure was neither shockingly degrading nor egregiously humiliating.</p>
<p id="c0ef51cb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Van Zee argues that because the pleadings do not include his release forms, the district court’s reliance on them converted Hanson’s motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, without permitting him the opportunity to respond. “If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6. . . . , matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). “All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.” <i>Id.</i> “[C]onstructive notice that the court intends to consider matters outside the complaint can be sufficient.” Country Club Estates, L.L.C. v. Town of Loma Linda, 213 F.3d 1001, 1005 (8th Cir. 2000). “Consideration of matters outside the pleading is harmless where the nonmoving party had an adequate opportunity to respond to the motion and material facts were neither disputed nor missing from the record.” BJC Health Sys. v.

<p id="c0ef51cc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Van Zee had (at least) constructive notice that the district court intended to consider matters outside the complaint when the court, by memorandum to counsel in August 2009, requested copies of any release forms Van Zee signed when enlisting in the Army. Van Zee’s counsel responded, forwarding copies of Van Zee’s signed forms. <span title="699" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-699">p. 699</span>The court dismissed Van Zee’s complaint in February 2010.

<p id="c0ef51cd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to Van Zee, the district court deprived him of the opportunity to dispute whether Hanson received a copy of the release, and if so, the legal effect of it. While these issues might affect whether Hanson committed a common-law tort or violated South Dakota law, they have no effect on whether she violated Van Zee’s Fourteenth Amendment rights. To demonstrate a breach of privacy amounting to a constitutional violation, Van Zee must allege facts showing a legitimate expectation that his juvenile records would not be disclosed to the recruiter. Van Zee does not dispute that he told the recruiter he had a juvenile record and signed forms requesting the release of his juvenile records to the recruiter. The undisputed facts indicate Van Zee expected his juvenile records to be disclosed as part of his background check. Any Rule 12(d) error committed by the district court was harmless. . . . </p>

Under 28 U.S.C. §1291 the courts of appeals have jurisdiction only to hear appeals from final judgments; 28 U.S.C. §1292(a)(1) expands that jurisdiction to make certain interlocutory judgments—including either the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction or similar order—immediately appealable. The remaining choices all result in non-final orders that would not be appealable until a final judgment in the case.</p>
<p id="c0efc726-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q2.</b> B and C are the only correct responses. A is incorrect because the outcome—the quantum of damages—on the implied warranty theory is the same as for the express warranty; Customer therefore did not suffer an adverse judgment: He got exactly what he would have gotten had he prevailed on the implied warranty theory. D is incorrect, because only a party who suffers an “adverse” judgment—one that yielded a worse result than he was arguably entitled to—can appeal. B is correct because the Retailer did suffer an adverse judgment. C is correct because the measure of damages on the misrepresentation claim might be greater than on the warranty claims (given the availability of punitive damages for the misrepresentation claim), and to that extent Customer suffered an adverse outcome.</p>
<p id="c0efc727-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q3.</b> B and C are the only correct responses. A is wrong because findings of fact, whether made by a judge or jury, are protected by the clearly erroneous standard (see Rule 52(a)(6) and <i>Anderson v. Bessemer City</i>, supra page 692). D is wrong because reviewing courts hold trial courts to a higher standard on questions of law than for those of fact: A trial court that gets a salient legal standard wrong will be reversed, even if it’s just a “little” wrong, unless the error had no effect on the outcome of the case.</p>
<p id="c0efc728-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4.</b> B and D are the correct responses. A is wrong for reasons explained in <i>Liberty Insurance Co v. Wetzel</i>, supra page 673. B is correct; the entry of judgment starts the time to appeal running. C is incorrect for the reasons explained supra page 681. D is correct because the Rules drafters have provided this as an alternate route designed to protect litigants from judges who fail to carry through by providing the “separate document” embodying the judgment. See Rule 52(c)(2)(B).</p>
