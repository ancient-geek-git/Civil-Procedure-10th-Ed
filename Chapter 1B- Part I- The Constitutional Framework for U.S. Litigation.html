<p id="c072f5f5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One can study the procedural system from the top down or from the bottom up. The top-down approach starts with the constitutional environment in which the individual lawsuit exists. That approach takes the student into both the history and the current interpretation of the Constitution of the United States. Studying the Constitution reveals several limits on the ways in which state and federal court systems conduct their business—limits that have major consequences for individual litigants. The bottom-up approach begins with the life cycle of an individual lawsuit: how the parties initially state their grievances, develop information about them, and bring them to resolution. This approach emphasizes features and problems of the contemporary procedural system, which is in many respects a bold experiment. Studying the process of litigation reveals how these features shape and constrain the litigants’ responsibilities and choices.</p>
<p id="c0731d06-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you have probably already guessed, anyone wanting to become a lawyer has to understand both approaches, to comprehend the constitutional environment as well as the modes for processing disputes. This book accordingly contains materials about both approaches, and most courses will examine both. But one can with equal validity start at the top and work down or begin at the bottom and work up. The three parts of this book are labeled to emphasize these different starting <span title="62" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-62">p. 62</span>points. Some courses may begin with Part I: The Constitutional Framework for U.S. Litigation, comprising Chapters 2-4. This starting point represents the “top-down” approach. Other classes may move first to Part II: The Process of Litigation, comprising Chapters 5-11 and representing the “bottom-up” approach. The last part of this book, Part III: Probing the Boundaries: Additional Claims and Parties, combines significant elements of both the other parts and may be studied either at the end of the course, as a reprise, or in conjunction with either of the other two parts. The next three chapters represent an approach to litigation starting at the top—with the constitutional framework.</p>

<p id="c0731d09-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The U.S. Constitution dictates many fundamental aspects of a lawsuit—not only in landmark cases but in ordinary civil litigation. For example, someone looking at the U.S. system from the outside might conclude that it would be more efficient to have a single, unitary court system for all disputes rather than 51 separate systems (one for each state and one for the federal government). Efficient it might be, but it would also be unconstitutional, for reasons you will come to understand. The next three chapters develop several of the most important ways the Constitution shapes litigation in the United States. Two of those ways involve “jurisdiction,” a protean and important word in U.S. litigation; a third involves “choice of law.”</p>
<div id="c0731d0a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0731d0b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">1.&nbsp;The Idea of Jurisdiction</p></h3></div>


<p id="c0731d0c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No legal system in the world claims the power to decide all disputes arising anywhere. Which cases, then, will a legal system resolve? Consider this question concretely. Imagine that you live in Illinois and come to California to attend law school. A particularly contentious sort, you become involved in two disputes during your first year there: You think your landlord is failing to maintain your apartment, and you think one of your instructors unfairly rejects you for a position as a part-time research assistant. In the first case, you might start by complaining to the landlord; in the second, to the instructor or the dean. You would <i>not</i> seek relief from the landlord of the building next door or from the dean of another law school. You would not do so because the landlord of the other building and the dean of the other school have no power over the conditions in your apartment or school. Putting the matter very loosely, one could say the condition of your apartment and the employment decision fall outside of their <i>jurisdictions</i>: Say what they might about the poor state of garbage collection or the unfairness of failing to hire you, they are powerless to remedy either.</p>
<p id="c0731d0d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You will repeatedly encounter the concept of jurisdiction while studying law and will soon discover that the term is used in several different ways. More or less literally, “jurisdiction” means the power to declare the law. By extension, it has acquired several other meanings. Lawyers may speak of “the law of a jurisdiction” or “legislative jurisdiction,” using the term in both instances to <span title="63" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-63">p. 63</span>signify a state or territory whose government has the power to make law within its bounds. In civil procedure it has a narrower meaning. Lawyers sometimes refer to jurisdiction in this narrower sense as “judicial jurisdiction”: the power of a court to render a judgment that other courts and government agencies will recognize and enforce.</p>
<p id="c0731d0e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You might encounter jurisdiction in this narrower legal sense if your two imaginary disputes escalated and you sued either the landlord or the instructor. If during the dispute with your landlord you returned to Illinois for the summer and there filed an action against your California landlord, you might well be met with the defense that courts in Illinois have no jurisdiction over the landlord. If you filed suit in federal court in California against the instructor, a different kind of jurisdiction question might arise. While conceding that the instructor could be sued in California, the defendants might challenge the jurisdiction of <i>federal</i> courts over the lawsuit: Whether the challenge was successful would depend on whether you could either frame your challenge to the hiring decision as a claim “arising under federal law” or convince the court that you were still a “citizen” of Illinois and that you and the defendant(s) were thus of diverse citizenship.</p>

<p id="c0736b38-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next two chapters explore the ways in which courts in the United States conceive of and resolve questions like those raised in the preceding hypothetical case. Exploring the topic will be easier if you have some sense of both the terminology and the context in which jurisdictional issues arise. The basic terminology requires the student to distinguish between “personal” jurisdiction, the focus of Chapter 2, and “subject matter” jurisdiction, the focus of Chapter 3. Lawyers would describe the challenge to the Illinois suit against your California landlord as involving a question of <i>personal jurisdiction</i>—the power of an Illinois court to render a judgment binding someone who may have never set foot in Illinois. They would describe <span title="64" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-64">p. 64</span>the challenge to the federal courts’ power to decide the question whether you were wrongly refused a part-time job as raising the issue of federal courts’ <i>subject matter jurisdiction</i>—the power of federal (as opposed to state) courts to decide certain kinds of cases. At the outset you need only bear in mind that personal and subject matter jurisdiction are <i>both</i> necessary ingredients of any court’s power to render a binding decision in a case; that is, a court must have both subject matter and personal jurisdiction to render a valid judgment.</p>
<p id="c0736b39-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The deep concern with jurisdiction ranks high among the distinguishing characteristics of the Anglo-American legal system. The concept has special significance in the United States, where government power is divided among states and between the states as a whole and the federal government: No single government entity has plenary power. This system of limited and overlapping authority means that government agencies—including courts—must repeatedly decide which agency has the power to exercise authority in a given situation. Because the federal Constitution defines the lines of authority among the competing centers of power, courts look to the Constitution for their basic framework in deciding issues of judicial jurisdiction. This aspect of civil procedure will be for many students their first law school encounter with the Constitution, the text of which appears in the supplement that accompanies this casebook.</p>
<p id="c0736b3a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three parts of the Constitution bear on jurisdiction. Article III authorizes the establishment of the system of federal courts and in §2 sets the limits of federal judicial authority. Federal courts cannot exceed those jurisdictional boundaries, and Congress has the power in many instances to restrict the scope of federal judicial authority more narrowly than does the Constitution. The constraints imposed by Article III and the legislation implementing it are the focus of Chapter 3, on subject matter jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="c0736b3b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Article IV, §1 requires that “Full Faith and Credit  . . .  be given in each State to judicial proceedings of every other State.” The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to require that one state recognize and enforce judgments of another state. For example, suppose a court in State <i>A</i> enters a judgment for $100,000 against <i>D</i>, but plaintiff cannot find any assets of <i>D</i> within State <i>A</i> to satisfy the judgment. <i>D</i>’s only assets turn out to be a large bank account at a bank located in State <i>B</i>. Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause (and state legislation implementing it), plaintiff commences a summary proceeding in a court in State <i>B</i>, records State <i>A</i>’s judgment, and can then obtain a writ of execution from the State <i>B</i> court enforcing State <i>A</i>’s judgment against any assets of <i>D</i> located in State <i>B</i>. As you are about to see, however, the Full Faith and Credit Clause has an important unstated condition—such judgments are entitled to full faith and credit only if the court rendering them had jurisdiction to do so.</p>
<p id="c0736b3c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no “State [shall] deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.” This clause, known as the Due Process Clause, has proved to be one of the cornerstones of modern constitutional and procedural theory. It derives its relation to jurisdiction from <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>, a case that might be termed the great-grandparent of personal jurisdiction, the topic of Chapter 2. As you will see, <i>Pennoyer</i> made the question of what we now call personal jurisdiction part of the Constitution.<span title="65" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-65">p. 65</span></p>

<p id="c073b968-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beyond personal and subject matter jurisdiction, the Constitution shapes U.S. litigation in a third way: It sometimes dictates which set of laws a court must apply to a dispute. There are two key ways in which the Constitution dictates choice of law. First, Article VI provides that the Constitution and federal laws “shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.” This provision is commonly referred to as the Supremacy Clause. Although the Supremacy Clause typically arises in a Constitutional Law class rather than in Civil Procedure, for present purposes it is enough to understand that the clause means that if Congress has validly enacted a statute dealing with a particular subject, both federal and state courts are required to enforce the federal statute, regardless of whether there is a contrary state statute or state common law rule.</p>
<p id="c073b969-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="66" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-66">p. 66</span>The second way in which the Constitution dictates choice of law is that, in the absence of a controlling federal statute, the federal court system is required to respect both the statutory and common law rules of the several states. For an example of how such an issue might arise, imagine that your hypothetical dispute with your California landlord found its way to a federal court. Which law would the court apply to the dispute? Would it be bound by the California law of landlord and tenant? Or would it be free to apply what it thought was a more sensible or just system of regulation to the dispute before it? That question is the focus of Chapter 4, and is answered in significant part by the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Erie Railroad v. Tompkins</i>. <i>Erie</i> is a case of constitutional dimensions—or so it insists—but, unlike personal or subject matter jurisdiction, one cannot readily locate the constitutional provisions from which it flows; that enigma itself is part of the problem. Together with personal and subject matter jurisdiction, the Supremacy Clause and the <i>Erie</i> doctrine shape the environment in which U.S. litigation operates.</p>
