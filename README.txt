ABOUT
This is a patched together html e-book. It's meant to allow students to access their textbook in a browser without needing to use the distracting interface that textbook publishers force students to use. With this version, you can print as much as you want, edit the text to make corrections, access the book from unlimited devices, and keep it indefinitely without worrying that a company will cut off your access to the text that you paid for. 

These html files are also much easier to use than a scanned pdf of the book. An html file of the complete book is a much smaller file than an equivalent pdf, so it won't freeze or tax your computer. Footnote hyperlinks within the document will jump you to the note at the bottom of the webpage. The TOC and Index should also work: clicking on a page number hyperlink will open the html file of the whole book and then jump to the page you selected.  

Be aware that if you rename files, especially the file of the whole book ("Civil Procedure.html"), the TOC and Index links will break. The book's appearance will change if you move the html files out of the folder with "style.css" in it.

No annotation tools -- that's something you'll have to use on the publishers' websites.
