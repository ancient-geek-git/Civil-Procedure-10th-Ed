<p id="c076788c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Personal jurisdiction doctrine concerns, in the simplest terms, a state’s ability to assert power over a defendant in a civil lawsuit. It became part of U.S. constitutional law because of <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>, a case whose facts spawned a truly splendid doctrinal elaboration. To understand those facts you need to have some background. One of the more difficult parts of a lawsuit often comes at its end, when a victorious plaintiff tries to collect the judgment from the defendant, who declines to pay. When this happens, the plaintiff may obtain a writ of execution from the court, which will authorize the sheriff to seize any property belonging to the defendant, sell it (typically through an auction), and give the resulting money to the plaintiff (up to the amount of the judgment). When that sale occurs, the sheriff gives to whomever buys the defendant’s property a “sheriff’s deed” as evidence of title. The second piece of background you need for <i>Pennoyer</i> concerns the idea of “constructive” notice. In law “constructive” generally means “fictional” or “pretend.” Defendants generally receive service of process, but what happens if no one can find the defendant? Under those conditions some states provide for a notice in a newspaper—in those fine-print columns no one reads. Under such conditions notice is “constructive” because it is highly unlikely that the defendant will actually see it. Finally, you need to know that “attachment” is the legal term for an officially sanctioned seizure of property: Real estate, cars, and other property may be “attached.” Sometimes “attachment” means literal seizure; other times it means posting notices on property or on records of title so that prospective buyers know it cannot be sold by the owner with title.<span title="68" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-68">p. 68</span></p>

<p id="c0767892-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The case concerned two lawsuits. The first suit grew from an unpaid legal fee. Marcus Neff hired Mitchell, a lawyer living and practicing in Oregon, to do some legal work. When Neff failed to pay Mitchell’s fee (evidently less than $300), Mitchell sued him in state court. At the time of this first suit Neff was, in the court’s words, “a non-resident of the State [who] was not personally served with process, and did not appear [i.e., did not come to court or otherwise resist the lawsuit]. . . . [J]udgment was entered upon his default in not answering the complaint, upon a constructive service of summons by publication.” <i>After</i> this default judgment, Neff acquired 300 acres of land (allegedly worth $15,000) in Oregon from the federal government. To satisfy his judgment Mitchell had the sheriff seize and sell Neff’s land. Pennoyer bought it and received a sheriff’s deed as evidence of title. The sheriff then turned the sale proceeds over to Mitchell. Sometime after these events Neff reappeared, and when he discovered what had become of his land, he brought the second lawsuit with which <i>Pennoyer</i> is concerned. Neff sued Pennoyer in federal court “to recover the possession of [the] tract of land.” As evidence of their respective titles, Neff pointed to the original government deed, and Pennoyer pointed to the sheriff’s deed. In this second suit the court thus had to decide whether the first lawsuit and the sheriff’s sale had extinguished Neff’s title. The opinion begins with an analysis of the form of notice in the first suit.]</p>
<p id="c0767893-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Code of Oregon provides for such [constructive] service when an action is brought against a non-resident and absent defendant, who has property within the State. It also provides, where the action is for the recovery of money or damages, for the attachment of the property of the non-resident. And it also declares that no natural person is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of the State, “unless he appear in the court, or be found within the State, or be a resident thereof, or have property therein; and, in the last case, only to the extent of such property at the time the jurisdiction attached.” Construing this latter provision to mean that, in an action for money or damages where a defendant does not appear in the court, and is not found within the State, and is not a resident thereof, but has property therein, the jurisdiction of the court extends only over such property, the declaration expresses a principle of general, if not universal, law. The authority of every tribunal is necessarily restricted by the territorial limits of the State in which it is established. Any attempt to exercise authority beyond those limits would be deemed in every other forum, as has been said by this court, an illegitimate assumption of power, and be resisted as mere abuse. D’Arcy v. Ketchum et al., 11 How. 165. In the case against the plaintiff, the property here in controversy sold under the judgment rendered was not attached, nor in any way brought under the jurisdiction of the court. Its first connection with the case was caused by a levy of the execution. It was not, therefore, disposed of pursuant to any adjudication, but only in enforcement of a personal judgment, having no relation to the property, rendered against a non-resident without service of process upon him in the action, or his appearance therein. The court below did not consider <span title="69" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-69">p. 69</span>that an attachment of the property was essential to its jurisdiction or to the validity of the sale, but held that the judgment was invalid from defects in the affidavit upon which the order of publication was obtained, and in the affidavit by which the publication was proved.</p>
<p id="c0769fa4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is some difference of opinion among the members of this court as to the rulings upon these alleged defects [about whether the statute required an affidavit from the “printer,” as the statute specified, or whether one from the editor would suffice]. If, therefore, we were confined to the rulings of the court below upon the defects in the affidavits mentioned, we should be unable to uphold its decision. But it was also contended in that court, and is insisted upon here, that the judgment in the State court against the plaintiff was void for want of personal service of process on him, or of his appearance in the action in which it was rendered, and that the premises in controversy could not be subjected to the payment of the demand of a resident creditor except by a proceeding in rem; that is, by a direct proceeding against the property for that purpose. If these positions are sound, the ruling of the Circuit Court as to the invalidity of that judgment must be sustained, notwithstanding our dissent from the reasons upon which it was made. And that they are sound would seem to follow from two well-established principles of public law respecting the jurisdiction of an independent State over persons and property. The several States of the Union are not, it is true, in every respect independent, many of the rights and powers which originally belonged to them being now vested in the government created by the Constitution. But, except as restrained and limited by that instrument, they possess and exercise the authority of independent States, and the principles of public law to which we have referred are applicable to them. One of these principles is, that every State possesses exclusive jurisdiction and sovereignty over persons and property within its territory. As a consequence, every State has the power to determine for itself the civil status and capacities of its inhabitants; to prescribe the subjects upon which they may contract, the forms and solemnities with which their contracts shall be executed, the rights and obligations arising from them, and the mode in which their validity shall be determined and their obligations enforced; and also to regulate the manner and conditions upon which property situated within such territory, both personal and real, may be acquired, enjoyed, and transferred. The other principle of public law referred to follows from the one mentioned; that is, that no State can exercise direct jurisdiction and authority over persons or property without its territory. Story, Confl. Laws, c. 2; Wheat. Int. Law, pt. 2, c. 2. The several States are of equal dignity and authority, and the independence of one implies the exclusion of power from all others. And so it is laid down by jurists, as an elementary principle, that the laws of one State have no operation outside of its territory, except so far as is allowed by comity; and that no tribunal established by it can extend its process beyond that territory so as to subject either persons or property to its decisions. “Any exertion of authority of this sort beyond this limit,” says Story, “is a mere nullity, and incapable of binding such persons or property in any other tribunals.” Story, Confl. Laws, sect. 539.</p>
<p id="c0769fa5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But as contracts made in one State may be enforceable only in another State, and property may be held by non-residents, the exercise of the jurisdiction which every State is admitted to possess over persons and property within its own territory will often affect persons and property without it. To any influence exerted in this way by <span title="70" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-70">p. 70</span>a State affecting persons resident or property situated elsewhere, no objection can be justly taken; whilst any direct exertion of authority upon them, in an attempt to give ex-territorial operation to its laws, or to enforce an ex-territorial jurisdiction by its tribunals, would be deemed an encroachment upon the independence of the State in which the persons are domiciled or the property is situated, and be resisted as usurpation.</p>
<p id="c0769fa6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus the State, through its tribunals, may compel persons domiciled within its limits to execute, in pursuance of their contracts respecting property elsewhere situated, instruments in such form and with such solemnities as to transfer the title, so far as such formalities can be complied with; and the exercise of this jurisdiction in no manner interferes with the supreme control over the property by the State within which it is situated.</p>
<p id="c0769fa7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So the State, through its tribunals, may subject property situated within its limits owned by non-residents to the payment of the demand of its own citizens against them; and the exercise of this jurisdiction in no respect infringes upon the sovereignty of the State where the owners are domiciled. Every State owes protection to its own citizens; and, when non-residents deal with them, it is a legitimate and just exercise of authority to hold and appropriate any property owned by such non-residents to satisfy the claims of its citizens. It is in virtue of the State’s jurisdiction over the property of the non-resident situated within its limits that its tribunals can inquire into that non-resident’s obligations to its own citizens, and the inquiry can then be carried only to the extent necessary to control the disposition of the property. If the non-residents have no property in the State, there is nothing upon which the tribunals can adjudicate. . . . </p>
<p id="c0769fa8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If, without personal service, judgments <i>in personam</i>, obtained ex parte against non-residents and absent parties, upon mere publication of process, which, in the great majority of cases, would never be seen by the parties interested, could be upheld and enforced, they would be the constant instruments of fraud and oppression. Judgments for all sorts of claims upon contracts and for torts, real or pretended, would be thus obtained, under which property would be seized, when the evidence of the transactions upon which they were founded, if they ever had any existence, had perished.</p>
<p id="c0769fa9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Substituted service by publication, or in any other authorized form, may be sufficient to inform parties of the object of proceedings taken where property is once brought under the control of the court by seizure or some equivalent act. The law assumes that property is always in the possession of its owner, in person or by agent; and it proceeds upon the theory that its seizure will inform him, not only that it is taken into the custody of the court, but that he must look to any proceedings authorized by law upon such seizure for its condemnation and sale. Such service may also be sufficient in cases where the object of the action is to reach and dispose of property in the State, or of some interest therein, by enforcing a contract or a lien respecting the same, or to partition it among different owners, or, when the public is a party, to condemn and appropriate it for a public purpose. In other words, such service may answer in all actions which are substantially proceedings in rem. But where the entire object of the action is to determine the personal rights and obligations of the defendants, that is, where the suit is merely in personam, constructive service in this form upon a nonresident is ineffectual for any purpose. Process from the tribunals of one <span title="71" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-71">p. 71</span>State cannot run into another State, and summon parties there domiciled to leave its territory and respond to proceedings against them. Publication of process or notice within the State where the tribunal sits cannot create any greater obligation upon the non-resident to appear: Process sent to him out of the State, and process published within it, are equally unavailing in proceedings to establish his personal liability. . . . </p>
<p id="c0769faa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The Court then responded to Pennoyer’s argument that it should make no difference whether Oregon had attached Neff’s property at the outset of Mitchell’s lawsuit against Neff, or whether Oregon seized Neff’s property after Mitchell had obtained the judgment against Neff for the unpaid attorneys’ fees.] [The Oregon court’s] jurisdiction in that respect cannot be made to depend upon facts to be ascertained after it has tried the cause and rendered the judgment. If the judgment be previously void, it will not become valid by the subsequent discovery of property of the defendant, or by his subsequent acquisition of it. The judgment, if void when rendered, will always remain void: it cannot occupy the doubtful position of being valid if property be found, and void if there be none. . . . [T]he validity of every judgment depends upon the jurisdiction of the court before it is rendered, not upon what may occur subsequently. . . . </p>
<p id="c0769fab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Webster v. Reid</i>, reported in 11th of Howard, the plaintiff claimed title to land sold under judgments recovered in suits brought in a territorial court of Iowa, upon publication of notice under a law of the territory, without service of process; and the court said: “These suits were not a proceeding in rem against the land, but were in personam against the owners of it. . . . No person is required to answer in a suit on whom process has not been served, or whose property has not been attached. In this case, there was no personal notice, nor an attachment or other proceeding against the land, until after the judgments. The judgments, therefore, are nullities, and did not authorize the executions on which the land was sold.”</p>
<p id="c0769fac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The force and effect of judgments rendered against non-residents without personal service of process upon them, or their voluntary appearance, have been the subject of frequent consideration in the courts of the United States and of the several States, as attempts have been made to enforce such judgments in States other than those in which they were rendered, under the provision of the Constitution requiring that “full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other State”; and the act of Congress [current version at 28 U.S.C. §1738] providing for the mode of authenticating such acts, records, and proceedings, and declaring that, when thus authenticated, “they shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the State from which they are or shall be taken.” In the earlier cases, it was supposed that the act gave to all judgments the same effect in other States which they had by law in the State where rendered. But this view was afterwards qualified so as to make the act applicable only when the court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject-matter, and not to preclude an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court in which the judgment was rendered, or the right of the State itself to exercise authority over the person or the subject-matter. M’Elmoyle v. Cohen, 13 Pet. 312. . . . </p>
<p id="c076c6bd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, the validity of such judgments may be directly questioned, and their enforcement in <span title="72" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-72">p. 72</span>the State resisted, on the ground that proceedings in a court of justice to determine the personal rights and obligations of parties over whom that court has no jurisdiction do not constitute due process of law. Whatever difficulty may be experienced in giving to those terms a definition which will embrace every permissible exertion of power affecting private rights, and exclude such as is forbidden, there can be no doubt of their meaning when applied to judicial proceedings. They then mean a course of legal proceedings according to those rules and principles which have been established in our systems of jurisprudence for the protection and enforcement of private rights. To give such proceedings any validity, there must be a tribunal competent by its constitution—that is, by the law of its creation—to pass upon the subject-matter of the suit; and, if that involves merely a determination of the personal liability of the defendant, he must be brought within its jurisdiction by service of process within the State, or his voluntary appearance.</p>
<p id="c076c6be-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Except in cases affecting the personal status of the plaintiff, and cases in which that mode of service may be considered to have been assented to in advance, as hereinafter mentioned, the substituted service of process by publication, allowed by the law of Oregon and by similar laws in other States, where actions are brought against non-residents, is effectual only where, in connection with process against the person for commencing the action, property in the State is brought under the control of the court, and subjected to its disposition by process adapted to that purpose, or where the judgment is sought as a means of reaching such property or affecting some interest therein; in other words, where the action is in the nature of a proceeding in rem. As stated by Cooley in his Treatise on Constitutional Limitations, 405, for any other purpose than to subject the property of a non-resident to valid claims against him in the State, “due process of law would require appearance or personal service before the defendant could be personally bound by any judgment rendered.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c076c6bf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It follows from the views expressed that the personal judgment recovered in the State court of Oregon against the plaintiff herein, then a non-resident of the State, was without any validity, and did not authorize a sale of the property in controversy.</p>
<p id="c076c6c0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To prevent any misapplication of the views expressed in this opinion, it is proper to observe that we do not mean to assert, by anything we have said, that a State may not authorize proceedings to determine the status of one of its citizens towards a non-resident, which would be binding within the State, though made without service of process or personal notice to the non-resident. The jurisdiction which every State possesses to determine the civil status and capacities of all its inhabitants involves authority to prescribe the conditions on which proceedings affecting them may be commenced and carried on within its territory. The State, for example, has absolute right to prescribe the conditions upon which the marriage relation between its own citizens shall be created, and the causes for which it may be dissolved. . . . </p>
<p id="c076c6c1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neither do we mean to assert that a State may not require a non-resident entering into a partnership or association within its limits, or making contracts enforceable there, to appoint an agent or representative in the State to receive service of process and notice in legal proceedings instituted with respect to such partnership, association, or contracts, or to designate a place where such service may be made and notice given, and provide, upon their failure, to make such appointment or to designate such place that service may be made upon a public officer designated for that purpose, or <span title="73" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-73">p. 73</span>in some other prescribed way, and that judgments rendered upon such service may not be binding upon the nonresidents both within and without the State. . . . Nor do we doubt that a State, on creating corporations or other institutions for pecuniary or charitable purposes, may provide a mode in which their conduct may be investigated, their obligations enforced, or their charters revoked, which shall require other than personal service upon their officers or members.

<p id="c076c6c7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Pennoyer</i> established fundamental jurisdictional doctrine, the main outlines of which prevailed for a century and which is still good law in many respects. <i>Pennoyer</i> proclaims that its holding rests on the Constitution, and the opinion mentions both the Due Process and the Full Faith and Credit Clauses. That assertion has two entailments.</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="c076ecd8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, because the Due Process Clause restricts the power of state governments, the boundaries of personal jurisdiction proclaimed by the Supreme Court bind state courts. (They also bind federal courts for an additional reason: Rule 4(k)(1)(A) provides that the personal jurisdiction of a federal court shall be the same as the court of a state in which the federal court is sitting, unless a federal statute provides otherwise.)</p></li>
<li><p id="c076ecd9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Pennoyer</i>’s mention of the Full Faith and Credit Clause (U.S. Const. Art. IV, §1) points to a second constitutional issue. The opinion links full faith and credit to personal jurisdiction: The courts of State <i>Y</i> need not enforce a judgment against a defendant entered by the courts of State <i>X</i> if <i>X</i> lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant.</p></li>
<li><p id="c076ecda-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Pennoyer</i> also makes, in passing, a point about the nature of appellate review in the U.S. legal system. Consider the sentence: “If these positions are sound, the ruling of the Circuit Court as to the invalidity of that judgment must be sustained, notwithstanding our dissent from the reasons upon which it was made.” Appellate courts in the United States review <i>outcomes</i>, not reasoning; because in the Supreme Court’s view the lower court had reached the correct outcome, it affirmed, even though it came to that outcome by an entirely different—and at the time novel—line of reasoning.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c07713f3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As an example of the first problem, suppose a transaction much like that in <i>Pennoyer</i>: A New York purchaser buys a piece of property in Oregon. If title proves defective, could Purchaser sue Seller in New York? If Purchaser’s check bounces, could Oregon Seller sue Purchaser in Oregon? Unless distant parties can reliably resolve disputes, they will not deal with each other. How does <i>Pennoyer</i> answer these questions?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c07713f4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As an example of the second problem, imagine a world with the Full Faith and Credit Clause but without <i>Pennoyer</i>.

<li class=""><p id="c0773b0a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It thus becomes important both to recognize the conceptual structure implied by the extreme statements and then to understand how the opinion qualifies them.</p></li>

</li>
<li class=""><p id="c0773b0b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Let us start with the conceptual structure, which the opinion describes in the lofty Latinate phrases that divide the world into two jurisdictional categories: <i>in personam</i> and <i>in rem.</i> The case assumes that jurisdiction is about power and that one can divide power into two apparently distinct categories—power over persons and power over property. Making that distinction implies that one could sensibly think about Oregon’s having power over Neff’s property (had it gone about acquiring it in the proper way) as a question separate from its having power over Neff himself. Power over Neff himself came to be known as jurisdiction <i>in personam</i> (over the person); power over his property came to be known as jurisdiction <i>in rem</i> (over the thing). Modern legal scholars doubt that the distinction holds up. The best critique appears in Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr., <i>A General Theory of State-Court Jurisdiction</i>, 1965 S. Ct. Rev. 241. As you will see, in recent years the Supreme Court has reconsidered this distinction.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0773b0c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>In personam</i> jurisdiction looks, at first, refreshingly simple, as described by <i>Pennoyer</i>. To obtain jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant the plaintiff must arrange to have defendant personally served with process within the borders of the state in question. So, in the hypothetical in Note 3, Purchaser could sue Seller in New York only if he could serve him with process in New York; otherwise Seller would be beyond the range of the New York court’s power. In <i>Pennoyer</i>’s view, serving Neff by other means (e.g., by mail) or by personal service in a different state does not work. Working with the facts of <i>Pennoyer</i>, explain why the Oregon court did not obtain <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction over Neff.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0773b0d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>In rem</i> jurisdiction, the more obscure category, flows from a problem created by the rules for <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction: People sometimes own property distant from their usual personal residence. In the hypothetical case in Note 3, suppose that, after Purchaser of the Oregon land returned to New York, the check bounced, and Seller argued that he still owns the property. Can Purchaser, by remaining out of state—perhaps indefinitely—prevent Oregon from giving clean title back to Seller (and thus enabling him to sell to a solvent purchaser)? If <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction were the only possibility, nothing could be done until Purchaser returned to Oregon and could be served with process. Unwilling to see that result, the court created a <span title="76" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-76">p. 76</span>procedure by which a court located in the same state as the property could enter a judgment disposing of that property—by seizing it at the outset of the lawsuit. <i>Pennoyer</i> calls that procedure <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction. Working with the facts of <i>Pennoyer</i>, explain why the Oregon court did not obtain <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction over Neff.</p></li>

</li>
<li class=""><p id="c0773b0e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So far, so good in the world of concepts. The waters begin to cloud in the paragraph that begins “To prevent any misapplication. . . . ,” in which the opinion qualifies and retracts some of its broad statements. It does so in two ways:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0773b0f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It says that a state has jurisdiction over “the status of one of its citizens towards a non-resident.” What does that mean? The same paragraph tells us: it’s marriage and divorce. Without this paragraph Marcus Neff could abandon his wife in Oregon, move to another state, and leave her unable to obtain a divorce. The phrase just quoted suggests the hypothetical Mrs. Neff could obtain an Oregon divorce, because Oregon would have jurisdiction over her “status” as a married person, even if she could not locate or serve her husband in Oregon. In fact, courts wrestled with this situation for a century, wishing to allow abandoned spouses to obtain divorces, but not to allow abandoning spouses to move to another state and obtain a divorce without satisfying their obligations of support.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0773b10-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next paragraph of the opinion says that states can require someone doing business there “to appoint an agent or representative in the State to receive service of process and notice in legal proceedings instituted with respect to such” business. By thus “consenting” to service of process one would, in the world of <i>Pennoyer,</i> consent to jurisdiction. In the wake of <i>Pennoyer</i> many states passed statutes requiring those doing business in the state to appoint an agent—often a state official—empowered to receive process on their behalf.</p></li>

<p id="c0778946-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Pennoyer</i> has its feet planted in a pre-industrial world with communications that by modern standards seem slow and uncertain. The decade following <i>Pennoyer</i> saw enormous railroad construction. The last quarter of the nineteenth century also witnessed both a great expansion of industrial production and the proliferation of often interlocking corporations organizing that production. Within 50 years of the decision, other developments—the automobile, telegraph, and telephone—had nationalized economic life and even leisure activities in a way unforeseen by <i>Pennoyer</i>’s authors. As a consequence, many of the most difficult problems facing the courts after <i>Pennoyer</i> dealt with entities and situations to which <i>Pennoyer</i> only passingly alluded. Chief among those was the business corporation, a legal entity that could, through its employees, be “present” in many places at once.</p>

As noted above, one of the most frequent involved <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction over a defendant corporation. Ironically, the way out of the tangled path was suggested in a case involving not a corporation but a person. In Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457 (1940), two partners in an oil well sued each other. Meyer, the defendant, had been a resident of Wyoming but at the time of the suit was served personally in Colorado; Meyer did not appear in Wyoming, where the court rendered a judgment against him. Meyer attacked the Wyoming judgment collaterally (does this sound a lot like <i>Pennoyer</i> so far?). The U.S. Supreme Court held that the Wyoming judgment was valid, and in a paragraph that laid the groundwork for much future law said:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c077b05c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Domicile in the state is alone sufficient to bring an absent defendant within the reach of the state’s jurisdiction for purposes of a personal judgment by means of appropriate substituted service. Substituted service [i.e., service other than personal service in the forum state] in such cases has been quite uniformly upheld where the absent defendant was served at his usual place of abode in the state as well as where he was personally served without the state. That such substituted service may be wholly adequate to meet the requirements of due process was recognized by this Court in <i>McDonald v. Mabee</i> despite earlier intimations to the contrary. See Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714. Its adequacy so far as due process is concerned is dependent on whether or not the form of substituted service provided for such cases and employed is reasonably calculated to give him actual notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard. If it is, the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice (<i>McDonald v. Mabee</i>, <i>supra</i>) implicit in due process are satisfied. Here there can be no question on that score. Meyer did not merely receive actual notice of the Wyoming proceedings. While outside the state, he was personally served in accordance with a statutory scheme which Wyoming had provided for such occasions. And in our view the machinery employed met all the requirements of due process. Certainly then Meyer’s domicile in Wyoming was a sufficient basis for that extraterritorial service. As in [the] case of the authority of the United States over its absent citizens, the authority of a state over one of its citizens is not terminated by the mere fact of his absence from the state. The state which accords him privileges and affords protection to him and his property by virtue of his domicile may also exact reciprocal duties. “Enjoyment of the privileges of residence within the state, and the attendant right to invoke the protection of its laws, are inseparable” from the various incidences of state citizenship. The responsibilities of that citizenship arise <span title="79" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-79">p. 79</span>out of the relationship to the state which domicile creates. That relationship is not dissolved by mere absence from the state. The attendant duties, like the rights and privileges incident to domicile, are not dependent on continuous presence in the state. One such incidence of domicile is amenability to suit within the state even during sojourns without the state, where the state has provided and employed a reasonable method for apprising such an absent party of the proceedings against him.</p>

<p id="c077d773-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The questions for decision are (1) whether, within the limitations of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the appellant, a Delaware corporation, has by its activities in the State of Washington rendered itself amenable to proceedings in the courts of that state to recover unpaid contributions to the state unemployment compensation fund enacted by state statutes, Washington Unemployment Compensation Act, and (2) whether the state can exact those contributions consistently with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="c077d774-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statutes in question set up a comprehensive scheme of unemployment compensation, the costs of which are defrayed by contributions required to be made by employers to a state unemployment compensation fund. The contributions are a specified percentage of the wages payable annually by each employer for his employees’ services in the state. The assessment and collection of the contributions and the fund are administered by appellees. Section 14(c) of the Act authorizes appellee Commissioner to issue an order and notice of assessment of delinquent contributions upon prescribed personal service of the notice upon the employer if found within the state, or, if not so found, by mailing the notice to the employer by registered mail at his last known address. . . . </p>
<p id="c077d775-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case notice of assessment for the years in question was personally served upon a sales solicitor employed by appellant in the State of Washington, and a copy of the notice was mailed by registered mail to appellant at its address in St. Louis, Missouri. Appellant appeared specially before the office of unemployment and moved to set aside the order and notice of assessment on the ground that the service upon appellant’s salesman was not proper service upon appellant; that appellant was not a corporation of the State of Washington and was not doing business within the state; that it had no agent within the state upon whom service could be made; and that appellant is not an employer and does not furnish employment within the meaning of the statute. . . . </p>
<p id="c077d776-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts as found by the appeal tribunal and accepted by the state Superior Court and Supreme Court, are not in dispute. Appellant is a Delaware corporation, having its principal place of business in St. Louis, Missouri, and is engaged in the <span title="80" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-80">p. 80</span>manufacture and sale of shoes and other footwear. It maintains places of business in several states, other than Washington, at which its manufacturing is carried on and from which its merchandise is distributed interstate through several sales units or branches located outside the State of Washington.</p>
<p id="c077d777-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant has no office in Washington and makes no contracts either for sale or purchase of merchandise there. It maintains no stock of merchandise in that state and makes there no deliveries of goods in intrastate commerce. During the years from 1937 to 1940, now in question, appellant employed eleven to thirteen salesmen under direct supervision and control of sales managers located in St. Louis. These salesmen resided in Washington; their principal activities were confined to that state; and they were compensated by commissions based upon the amount of their sales. The commissions for each year totaled more than $31,000. Appellant supplies its salesmen with a line of samples, each consisting of one shoe of a pair, which they display to prospective purchasers. On occasion they rent permanent sample rooms, for exhibiting samples, in business buildings, or rent rooms in hotels or business buildings temporarily for that purpose. The cost of such rentals is reimbursed by appellant.</p>
<p id="c077d778-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The authority of the salesmen is limited to exhibiting their samples and soliciting orders from prospective buyers, at prices and on terms fixed by appellant. The salesmen transmit the orders to appellant’s office in St. Louis for acceptance or rejection, and when accepted the merchandise for filling the orders is shipped f.o.b. from points outside Washington to the purchasers within the state. All the merchandise shipped into Washington is invoiced at the place of shipment from which collections are made. No salesman has authority to enter into contracts or to make collections. . . . </p>
<p id="c077d779-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant. . . . insists that its activities within the state were not sufficient to. . . . [confer] jurisdiction. . . . And appellant further argues that since it was not present within the state, it is a denial of due process to subject it to taxation or other money exaction. It thus denies the power of the state to lay the tax or to subject appellant to a suit for its collection.</p>
<p id="c077d77a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Historically the jurisdiction of courts to render judgment in personam is grounded on their de facto power over the defendant’s person. Hence his presence within the territorial jurisdiction of a court was prerequisite to its rendition of a judgment personally binding him. <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>. But now that the capias ad respondendum has given way to personal service of summons or other form of notice, due process requires only that in order to subject a defendant to a judgment in personam, if he be not present within the territory of the forum, he have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.” Since the corporate personality is a fiction, although a fiction intended to be acted upon as though it were a fact, it is clear that unlike an individual its “presence” without, as well as within, the state of its origin can be manifested only by activities carried on in its behalf by those who are authorized to act for it. To say that the corporation is so far “present” there as to satisfy due process requirements, for purposes of taxation or the maintenance of suits against it in the courts of the state, is to beg the question to be decided. For the terms “present” or “presence” are used merely to symbolize those activities of the corporation’s agent within the state which courts will deem to be sufficient to satisfy the demands of due process. Those demands may be met by such contacts of the corporation with the state of the forum as to make it reasonable, in the context of our federal <span title="81" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-81">p. 81</span>system of government, to require the corporation to defend the particular suit which is brought there. An “estimate of the inconveniences” which would result to the corporation from a trial away from its “home” or principal place of business is relevant in this connection.</p>
<p id="c077d77b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Presence” in the state in this sense has never been doubted when the activities of the corporation there have not only been continuous and systematic, but also give rise to the liabilities sued on, even though no consent to be sued or authorization to an agent to accept service of process has been given. Conversely it has been generally recognized that the casual presence of the corporate agent or even his conduct of single or isolated items of activities in a state in the corporation’s behalf are not enough to subject it to suit on causes of action unconnected with the activities there. To require the corporation in such circumstances to defend the suit away from its home or other jurisdiction where it carries on more substantial activities has been thought to lay too great and unreasonable a burden on the corporation to comport with due process.</p>
<p id="c077d77c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While it has been held, in cases on which appellant relies, that continuous activity of some sorts within a state is not enough to support the demand that the corporation be amenable to suits unrelated to that activity, there have been instances in which the continuous corporate operations within a state were thought so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.</p>
<p id="c077d77d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, although the commission of some single or occasional acts of the corporate agent in a state sufficient to impose an obligation or liability on the corporation has not been thought to confer upon the state authority to enforce it, other such acts, because of their nature and quality and the circumstances of their commission, may be deemed sufficient to render the corporation liable to suit. True, some of the decisions holding the corporation amenable to suit have been supported by resort to the legal fiction that it has given its consent to service and suit, consent being implied from its presence in the state through the acts of its authorized agents. But more realistically it may be said that those authorized acts were of such a nature as to justify the fiction.</p>
<p id="c077d77e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is evident that the criteria by which we mark the boundary line between those activities which justify the subjection of a corporation to suit, and those which do not, cannot be simply mechanical or quantitative. The test is not merely, as has sometimes been suggested, whether the activity, which the corporation has seen fit to procure through its agents in another state, is a little more or a little less. Whether due process is satisfied must depend rather upon the quality and nature of the activity in relation to the fair and orderly administration of the laws which it was the purpose of the due process clause to insure. That clause does not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment in personam against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts, ties, or relations.</p>
<p id="c077d77f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But to the extent that a corporation exercises the privilege of conducting activities within a state, it enjoys the benefits and protection of the laws of that state. The exercise of that privilege may give rise to obligations, and, so far as those obligations arise out of or are connected with the activities within the state, a procedure which requires the corporation to respond to a suit brought to enforce them can, in most instances, hardly be said to be undue.</p>
<p id="c077fe90-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying these standards, the activities carried on in behalf of appellant in the State of Washington were neither irregular nor casual. They were systematic and continuous <span title="82" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-82">p. 82</span>throughout the years in question. They resulted in a large volume of interstate business, in the course of which appellant received the benefits and protection of the laws of the state, including the right to resort to the courts for the enforcement of its rights. The obligation which is here sued upon arose out of those very activities. It is evident that these operations establish sufficient contacts or ties with the state of the forum to make it reasonable and just, according to our traditional conception of fair play and substantial justice, to permit the state to enforce the obligations which appellant has incurred there. Hence we cannot say that the maintenance of the present suit in the State of Washington involves an unreasonable or undue procedure.</p>
<p id="c077fe91-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are likewise unable to conclude that the service of the process within the state upon an agent whose activities establish appellant’s “presence” there was not sufficient notice of the suit, or that the suit was so unrelated to those activities as to make the agent an inappropriate vehicle for communicating the notice. It is enough that appellant has established such contacts with the state that the particular form of substituted service adopted there gives reasonable assurance that the notice will be actual. Nor can we say that the mailing of the notice of suit to appellant by registered mail at its home office was not reasonably calculated to apprise appellant of the suit. . . . </p>
<p id="c077fe92-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant having rendered itself amenable to suit upon obligations arising out of the activities of its salesmen in Washington, the state may maintain the present suit in personam to collect the tax laid upon the exercise of the privilege of employing appellant’s salesmen within the state. For Washington has made one of those activities, which taken together establish appellant’s “presence” there for purposes of suit, the taxable event by which the state brings appellant within the reach of its taxing power. The state thus has constitutional power to lay the tax and to subject appellant to a suit to recover it. The activities which establish its “presence” subject it alike to taxation by the state and to suit to recover the tax.</p>

<p id="c077fe95-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I believe that the Federal Constitution leaves to each State, without any “ifs” or “buts,” a power to tax and to open the doors of its courts for its citizens to sue corporations whose agents do business in those States. Believing that the Constitution gave the States that power, I think it a judicial deprivation to condition its exercise upon this Court’s notion of “fair play,” however appealing that term may be. Nor can I stretch the meaning of due process so far as to authorize this Court to deprive a State of the right to afford judicial protection to its citizens on the ground that it would be more “convenient” for the corporation to be sued somewhere else.</p>
<p id="c077fe96-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is a strong emotional appeal in the words “fair play” “justice,” and “reasonableness.” But they were not chosen by those who wrote the original Constitution or the Fourteenth Amendment as a measuring rod for this Court to use in invalidating State or Federal laws passed by elected legislative representatives. No one, not even those who most feared a democratic government, ever formally proposed that courts should be given power to invalidate legislation under any such elastic standards. . . . </p>
<p id="c077fe97-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">True, the State’s power is here upheld.

One commentator has suggested that the basic test of <i>International Shoe</i> is a good one but that because of its generality it must be subjected to a process of “arbitrary particularization” in order to come up with workable rules. Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr., <i>A General Theory of State-Court Jurisdiction</i>, 1965 Sup. Ct. Rev. 241, 283.

Assume that International Shoe is incorporated in Delaware and has its headquarters and principal manufacturing operations in Missouri.

By contrast, a low level of activity (“contact,” in the jargon) will support jurisdiction, but only over claims related to that contact. The opinion hints at this idea, which has been elaborated in subsequent cases and commentary:</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0784ccd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>General jurisdiction.</i> In some cases the defendant will have such substantial contacts with the forum state to make it fair to assert jurisdiction even over claims unrelated to those contacts. For example, suppose an individual is a resident of California. She could be sued in California even over contracts or torts concluded or committed in other states or nations. Likewise, take a corporation like Microsoft, which has its chief place of business in Washington State. Under the theory of general jurisdiction, Microsoft could be sued in Washington even over contracts or torts concluded or committed in Idaho or Germany. As <i>Daimler AG v. Bauman</i> (infra page 133) put it, “A court may assert general jurisdiction over foreign (sister-state or foreign-country) corporations to hear any and all claims against them when their affiliations with the State are so ’continuous and systematic’ as to render them essentially at home in the forum State.” Later in this chapter we return to the question of general jurisdiction; for now, keep in mind the basic proposition that every individual and business entity in the United States has at least one state where they can be sued on any claim. To use the language of <i>Daimler</i>, an individual will be “at home” (and thus amenable to suit on all claims) in the state of her domicile. Corporations will similarly be “at home” both in the state of their incorporation and in the state that is their principal place of business (if that differs from their state of incorporation). In later cases, we will consider where <i>else</i> they can be sued.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0784cce-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Specific jurisdiction</i>. Where the defendant’s activities fall short of general jurisdiction, the minimum contacts analysis of <i>International Shoe</i> becomes important. In those cases courts worry both about the extent of those contacts and about the relation between defendants’ contacts with the state and the claim on which plaintiff is suing. Suppose, for example, Driver has never been in Missouri but, in the course of a vacation, enters the state, and injures a pedestrian. Specific jurisdiction would allow the injured pedestrian to sue Driver in Missouri on a claim arising from that accident—but <span title="86" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-86">p. 86</span>not on other, unrelated claims. As the <i>Daimler</i> Court put it, “<i>International Shoe</i> recognized, as well, that ’the commission of some single or occasional acts of the corporate agent in a state’ may sometimes be enough to subject the corporation to jurisdiction in that State’s tribunals with respect to suits relating to that in-state activity.” Commentators describe such cases as instances of specific jurisdiction, in which jurisdiction exists for the specific claim in question but not necessarily for other claims. In the decades following <i>International Shoe,</i> courts tried to work out its application to varying factual patterns. In particular, they wrestled with the question of whether the holding of <i>International Shoe</i> provided any limits: Was every defendant (at least every business defendant) subject to jurisdiction anywhere it did any business? Two cases decided by the Supreme Court about a decade after <i>International Shoe</i> gave contrasting answers to that question. Both are still frequently cited and present paradigmatic instances of the issues that arise in applying <i>International Shoe</i>.</p></li>

<p id="c07873e4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The material facts are relatively simple. In 1944, Lowell Franklin, a resident of California, purchased a life insurance policy from [an insurer subsequently bought by respondent, which] then mailed a reinsurance certificate to Franklin in California offering to insure him. . . . He accepted this offer and from that time until his death in 1950 paid premiums by mail from his California home to respondent’s Texas office. [When the beneficiary notified International Life of Franklin’s death,] it refused to pay, claiming that he had committed suicide[, a cause of death excluded by the policy]. It appears that neither [the original insurer] nor respondent has ever had any office or agent in California. . . . </p>
<p id="c07873e5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Looking back over this long history of [jurisdiction cases] a trend is clearly discernible toward expanding the permissible scope of state jurisdiction over foreign corporations and other nonresidents. In part this is attributable to the fundamental transformation of our national economy. . . . With this increasing nationalization of commerce has come a great increase in the amount of business conducted by mail across state lines. At the same time modern transportation and communication have made it much less burdensome for a party sued to defend himself in a State where he engages in economic activity. Turning to this case we think it apparent that the Due Process Clause did not preclude the California court from entering a judgment binding on respondent. It is sufficient for purposes of due process that the suit was based on a contract which had substantial connection with that State. The contract was delivered in California, the premiums were mailed from there and the insured was a resident of that State when he died. It cannot be denied that California has a manifest interest in providing effective means of redress for its residents when their insurers refuse to pay claims. These residents would be at a severe disadvantage if they were forced to follow the insurance company to a distant State in order to hold it <span title="87" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-87">p. 87</span>legally accountable. . . . There is no contention that respondent did not have adequate notice of the suit or sufficient time to prepare its defenses and appear.</p>

When she created the trust, she lived in Pennsylvania, but the trust was created in Delaware, with a Delaware bank as trustee. After creating the trust she moved to Florida, and later died there. Her will was probated in Florida. The case concerns whether the Florida court could obtain jurisdiction over the trust. That issue turned on whether Florida could acquire jurisdiction over the Delaware trustee. If Florida had jurisdiction, two daughters received everything, and a third daughter got nothing.

In response to these changes, the requirements for personal jurisdiction over nonresidents have evolved from the rigid rule of <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i> to the flexible standard of <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>. But it is a mistake to assume that this trend heralds the eventual demise of all restrictions on the personal jurisdiction of state courts. Those restrictions are more than a guarantee of immunity from inconvenient or distant litigation. They are a consequence of territorial limitations on the power of the respective States. However minimal the burden of defending in a foreign tribunal, a defendant may not be called upon to do so unless he has had the “minimal contacts” with that State that are a prerequisite to its exercise of power over him. See <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>.</p>
<p id="c0789afd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We fail to find such contacts in the circumstances of this case.

<p id="c078c217-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>International Shoe</i> provided a new framework for thinking about <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction over corporations. But the case left open other jurisdictional questions.</p>
<p id="c078c218-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>International Shoe</i> involved a corporate defendant (as did many of the most difficult jurisdictional questions), and it therefore did not discuss the applicability of its approach to jurisdiction over individuals. The second issue left untouched by <i>International Shoe</i> was <i>in rem</i> and <i>quasi in rem</i> jurisdiction. Under the line of cases descended from <i>Pennoyer</i>, the presence of property in the forum state could be the basis for jurisdiction over claims of any sort.</p>
<p id="c078c219-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here it makes sense to pause and offer a note on terminology. Some courts—like the <i>Pennoyer</i> Court—use <i>in rem</i> to describe all cases in which property is used as the basis for jurisdiction. Other courts distinguish between <i>in rem</i> and <i>quasi in rem</i> jurisdiction. They use the former term to describe cases in which ownership of the property itself is at stake: Does <i>X</i> own Blackacre? Such courts use <i>quasi in rem</i> to describe cases in which the property is used only as a jurisdictional hook to allow the litigation of a claim not related to that property. In this stricter terminology <i>Pennoyer</i> itself was a <i>quasi in rem</i> case; Mitchell was not claiming that he rather than Neff owned the property in question; he was instead trying to use the property as the basis for Oregon’s jurisdiction over his claim for an unpaid legal fee.</p>
<p id="c078c21a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While it lasted, <i>quasi in rem</i> jurisdiction created some strange doctrinal possibilities. The most unexpected elaboration of this branch of <i>Pennoyer</i> came in a series of cases holding that plaintiffs could obtain jurisdiction by seizing not only tangible property—land and chattels—but also debts owed to the defendant. Harris v. Balk, 198 U.S. 215 (1905), is probably the most bizarre of this line of cases. Harris owed Balk money, and Balk owed Epstein money; Balk lived in North Carolina, Epstein in Maryland. Harris journeyed from North Carolina to Maryland. While Harris was in Maryland, Epstein had him served with process, and a Maryland court entered a judgment saying that Harris should pay the money he owed Balk to <span title="89" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-89">p. 89</span>Epstein instead. Balk challenged the Maryland court’s power to enter this judgment (arguing that only personal service on him in Maryland would have justified such a judgment), but the Supreme Court upheld it. The consequence of <i>Harris</i> was that a state could acquire jurisdiction over persons whenever their debtors were present in that state by “attaching” the debts. The result was to make creditors liable (to the extent of amounts owed them) in any state in which their debtors set foot.</p>
<p id="c078c21b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under <i>Harris</i>’s extension of <i>Pennoyer</i>, for example, if Alfred Manhattanite had lent money to his friend Jane Gotham and she took a trip to Florida, that state had the power to enter a judgment directing Jane to pay someone besides Alfred the money she owed him—if Jane’s debt to Alfred were “attached” during her visit.</p>
<p id="c078c21c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lurking behind these somewhat extreme results was an undiscussed circumstance: <i>In rem</i> jurisdiction provided an escape from the results yielded by <i>Pennoyer</i>’s somewhat restrictive doctrines. To the extent, then, that <i>International Shoe</i> provided a more sensible way of thinking about <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction, one might not need <i>quasi in rem</i> jurisdiction—at least not in its more extravagant applications.</p>
<p id="c078e92d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These two themes—the applicability of <i>International Shoe</i> to individuals and the role of <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction—came together in <i>Shaffer v. Heitner</i>, the most important jurisdictional case after <i>International Shoe</i>.</p>

<p id="c078e933-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many U.S. businesses take the form of corporations. A corporation is an entity, typically chartered under the laws of a state. For a business, the corporate form has some advantages: It can outlast the lives of individual owners; it can make it easier to raise capital (by selling shares); it can insulate its owners from personal liability (the corporation, rather than individual shareholders, is liable for corporate obligations). It also has some disadvantages: Many states as well as the federal government impose taxes on corporations as well as their shareholders; and the corporation must comply with whatever regulations the chartering state imposes.</p>
<p id="c078e934-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the United States, many substantial corporations have chosen Delaware as their state of incorporation. It has relatively low corporate taxes and its laws allow the corporation great flexibility in conducting its affairs. <span title="90" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-90">p. 90</span>Moreover, Delaware maintains a separate Court of Chancery, whose judges become, in effect, corporate law specialists, allowing greater predictability in suits involving corporate matters.</p>
<p id="c078e935-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One such matter involves the fiduciary obligations of corporate directors. The members of the board of directors of a corporation owe it fiduciary obligations: The law requires directors to prudently conduct the affairs of the corporation—monitoring its financial and other affairs; hiring and firing its officers, who conduct day-to-day operations; and directing or overseeing major decisions of the corporation.</p>
<p id="c078e936-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like trustees, directors can be sued by their beneficiaries. But because the corporation is the beneficiary and is controlled by the directors, the prospect of such a suit to enforce the directors’ fiduciary duties is nil—unless a representative of the corporation who is independent of the directors may sue. American law has developed such a procedure, called the shareholder’s derivative suit. In a derivative action, a shareholder steps forward and sues the directors or officers in the name of the corporation, alleging some breach of fiduciary duty. If the suit is successful, the proceeds go to the corporation. Such suits have spawned numerous complex issues of procedural and corporate law as well as a good deal of controversy.</p>

<p id="c078e93c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The controversy in this case concerns the constitutionality of a Delaware statute that allows a court of that State to take jurisdiction of a lawsuit by sequestering any property of the defendant that happens to be located in Delaware. Appellants contend that the sequestration statute as applied in this case violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment both because it permits the state courts to exercise jurisdiction despite the absence of sufficient contacts among the defendants, the litigation, and the State of Delaware and because it authorizes the deprivation of defendants’ property without providing adequate procedural safeguards.

In essence, Heitner alleged that the individual defendants had violated their duties to Greyhound by causing it and its subsidiary to engage in actions that resulted in the corporation’s being held liable for substantial damages in a private antitrust suit and a large fine in a criminal contempt action.

These seizures were accomplished by placing “stop transfer” orders or their equivalents on the books of the Greyhound Corporation. So far as the record shows, none of the certificates representing the seized property was physically present in Delaware. The stock was considered to be in Delaware, and so subject to seizure, by virtue of 8 Del. C. §169, which makes Delaware the situs of ownership of all stock in Delaware corporations.</p>

International Life</i> as a “see also” citation for this proposition.] [T]he relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation, rather than the mutually exclusive sovereignty of the States on which the rules of <i>Pennoyer</i> rest, became the central concern of the inquiry into personal jurisdiction.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105CE_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N105CE_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">20</a></span> The immediate effect of this departure from <i>Pennoyer</i>’s conceptual apparatus was to increase the ability of the state courts to obtain personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants.</p>
<p id="c0791058-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No equally dramatic change has occurred in the law governing jurisdiction in rem. There have, however, been intimations that the collapse of the in personam wing of <i>Pennoyer</i> has not left that decision unweakened as a foundation for in rem jurisdiction.

<p id="c0791059-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear, therefore, that the law of state-court jurisdiction no longer stands securely on the foundation established in <i>Pennoyer</i>. We think that the time is ripe to consider whether the standard of fairness and substantial justice set forth in <i>International Shoe</i> should be held to govern actions in rem as well as in personam.</p>

<p id="c079105b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case for applying to jurisdiction in rem the same test of “fair play and substantial justice” as governs assertions of jurisdiction in personam is simple and straightforward. It is premised on recognition that “[t]he phrase, ’judicial jurisdiction over a thing,’ is a customary elliptical way of referring to jurisdiction over the interests of persons in a thing.” Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws §56, introductory note. This recognition leads to the conclusion that in order to justify an exercise of jurisdiction in rem, the basis for jurisdiction must be sufficient to justify exercising “jurisdiction over the interests of persons in a thing.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105F6_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N105F6_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">23</a></span> The standard for determining whether an exercise of jurisdiction over the interests of persons is consistent with the Due Process Clause is the minimum contacts standard elucidated in <i>International Shoe</i>.</p>
<p id="c079105d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This argument, of course, does not ignore the fact that the presence of property in a State may bear on the existence of jurisdiction by providing contacts among the forum State, the defendant, and the litigation. For example, when claims to the property itself <span title="93" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-93">p. 93</span>are the source of the underlying controversy between the plaintiff and the defendant, it would be unusual for the State where the property is located not to have jurisdiction. In such cases, the defendant’s claim to property located in the State would normally indicate that he expected to benefit from the State’s protection of his interest. The State’s strong interests in assuring the marketability of property within its borders and in providing a procedure for peaceful resolution of disputes about the possession of that property would also support jurisdiction, as would the likelihood that important records and witnesses will be found in the State.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10605_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10605_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">28</a></span> The presence of property may also favor jurisdiction in cases, such as suits for injury suffered on the land of an absentee owner, where the defendant’s ownership of the property is conceded but the cause of action is otherwise related to rights and duties growing out of that ownership.</p>
<p id="c079376f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It appears, therefore, that jurisdiction over many types of actions which now are or might be brought in rem would not be affected by a holding that any assertion of state-court jurisdiction must satisfy the <i>International Shoe</i> standard. For the type of quasi in rem action typified by <i>Harris v. Balk</i> and the present case, however, accepting the proposed analysis would result in significant change. These are cases where the property which now serves as the basis for state-court jurisdiction is completely unrelated to the plaintiff’s cause of action. Thus, although the presence of the defendant’s property in a State might suggest the existence of other ties among the defendant, the State, and the litigation, the presence of the property alone would not support the State’s jurisdiction. . . . </p>
<p id="c0793770-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since acceptance of the <i>International Shoe</i> test would most affect this class of cases, we examine the arguments against adopting that standard as they relate to this category of litigation. Before doing so, however, we note that this type of case also presents the clearest illustration of the argument in favor of assessing assertions of jurisdiction by a single standard. For in cases such as <i>Harris</i> and this one, the only role played by the property is to provide the basis for bringing the defendant into court. Indeed, the express purpose of the Delaware sequestration procedure is to compel the defendant to enter a personal appearance. In such cases, if a direct assertion of personal jurisdiction over the defendant would violate the Constitution, it would seem that an indirect assertion of the jurisdiction should be equally impermissible.</p>
<p id="c0793771-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The primary rationale for treating the presence of property as a sufficient basis for jurisdiction to adjudicate claims over which the State would not have jurisdiction if <i>International Shoe</i> applied is that a wrongdoer “should not be able to avoid payment of his obligations by the expedient of removing his assets to a place where he is not subject to an in personam suit.” Restatement §66, Comment a. This justification, however, does not explain why jurisdiction should be recognized without regard to whether the property is present in the State because of an effort to avoid the owner’s obligations. Nor does it support jurisdiction to adjudicate the underlying claim. . . . </p>
<p id="c0793772-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It might also be suggested that allowing in rem jurisdiction avoids the uncertainty inherent in the <i>International Shoe</i> standard and assures a plaintiff of a forum.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1062F_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1062F_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">37</a></span>. . . . [W]hen the existence of jurisdiction in a particular forum under <i>International Shoe</i> <span title="94" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-94">p. 94</span>is unclear, the cost of simplifying the litigation by avoiding the jurisdictional question may be the sacrifice of “fair play and substantial justice.” That cost is too high.</p>
<p id="c0793774-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are left, then, to consider the significance of the long history of jurisdiction based solely on the presence of property in a State. . . . “[T]raditional notions of fair play and substantial justice” can be as readily offended by the perpetuation of ancient forms that are no longer justified as by the adoption of new procedures that are inconsistent with the basic values of our constitutional heritage. The fiction that an assertion of jurisdiction over property is anything but an assertion of jurisdiction over the owner of the property supports an ancient form without substantial modern justification. Its continued acceptance would serve only to allow state court jurisdiction that is fundamentally unfair to the defendant.</p>
<p id="c0793775-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore conclude that all assertions of state court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in <i>International Shoe</i> and its progeny.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10649_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10649_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">39</a></span></p>

<p id="c0793778-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Delaware courts based their assertion of jurisdiction in this case solely on the statutory presence of appellants’ property in Delaware. Yet that property is not the subject matter of this litigation, nor is the underlying cause of action related to the property. Appellants’ holdings in Greyhound do not, therefore, provide contacts with Delaware sufficient to support the jurisdiction of that State’s courts over appellants. If it exists, that jurisdiction must have some other foundation.</p>
<p id="c0793779-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee Heitner did not allege and does not now claim that appellants have ever set foot in Delaware. Nor does he identify any act related to his cause of action as having taken place in Delaware. Nevertheless, he contends that appellants’ positions as directors and officers of a corporation chartered in Delaware provide sufficient “contacts, ties, or relations,” <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>, with that State to give its courts jurisdiction over appellants in this stockholder’s derivative action. This argument is based primarily on what Heitner asserts to be the strong interest of Delaware in supervising the management of a Delaware corporation. That interest is said to derive from the role of Delaware law in establishing the corporation and defining the obligations owed to it by its officers and directors. In order to protect this interest, appellee concludes, Delaware’s courts must have jurisdiction over corporate fiduciaries such as appellants.</p>
<p id="c079377a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This argument is undercut by the failure of the Delaware Legislature to assert the state interest appellee finds so compelling. Delaware law bases jurisdiction not on appellants’ status as corporate fiduciaries, but rather on the presence of their property in the State. Although the sequestration procedure used here may be most frequently used in derivative suits against officers and directors, the authorizing statute evinces no specific concern with such actions. Sequestration can be used in any suit against a nonresident, and reaches corporate fiduciaries only if they happen to own interests in a Delaware corporation, or other property in the State. But as Heitner’s failure to secure jurisdiction over seven of the defendants named in his complaint demonstrates, there is no necessary relationship between holding a position as a corporate fiduciary and owning stock or <span title="95" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-95">p. 95</span>other interests in the corporation. If Delaware perceived its interest in securing jurisdiction over corporate fiduciaries to be as great as Heitner suggests, we would expect it to have enacted a statute more clearly designed to protect that interest. . . . </p>
<p id="c079377b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee suggests that by accepting positions as officers or directors of a Delaware corporation, appellants performed the acts required by <i>Hanson v. Denckla</i>. He notes that Delaware law provides substantial benefits to corporate officers and directors, and that these benefits were at least in part the incentive for appellants to assume their positions. It is, he says, “only fair and just” to require appellants, in return for these benefits, to respond in the State of Delaware when they are accused of misusing their powers.</p>
<p id="c079377c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But like Heitner’s first argument, this line of reasoning establishes only that it is appropriate for Delaware law to govern the obligations of appellants to Greyhound and its stockholders. It does not demonstrate that appellants have “purposefully avail[ed themselves] of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State,” <i>Hanson v. Denckla</i>, in a way that would justify bringing them before a Delaware tribunal. Appellants have simply had nothing to do with the State of Delaware. Moreover, appellants had no reason to expect to be haled before a Delaware court. Delaware, unlike some States, has not enacted a statute that treats acceptance of a directorship as consent to jurisdiction in the State. And “[i]t strains reason. . . . to suggest that anyone buying securities in a corporation formed in Delaware ’impliedly consents’ to subject himself to Delaware’s. . . . jurisdiction on any cause of action.” Appellants, who were not required to acquire interests in Greyhound in order to hold their positions, did not by acquiring those interests surrender their right to be brought to judgment only in States with which they had “minimum contacts.” The Due Process Clause “does not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment. . . . against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts, ties, or relations.” <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>. Delaware’s assertion of jurisdiction over appellants in this case is inconsistent with that constitutional limitation on state power. The judgment of the Delaware Supreme Court must, therefore, be reversed.</p>

Washington</i> should be extended to govern assertions of in rem as well as in personam jurisdiction in state court. I also agree that neither the statutory presence of appellants’ stock in Delaware nor their positions as directors and officers of a Delaware corporation can provide sufficient contacts to support the Delaware courts’ assertion of jurisdiction in this case.</p>
<p id="c0795e91-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would explicitly reserve judgment, however, on whether the ownership of some forms of property whose situs is indisputably and permanently located within a State may, without more, provide the contacts necessary to subject a defendant to jurisdiction within the State to the extent of the value of the property. In the case of real property, in particular, preservation of the common law concept of quasi in rem jurisdiction arguably would avoid the uncertainty of the general <i>International Shoe</i> standard without significant cost to “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.” Subject to that reservation, I join the opinion of the Court.</p>

<p id="c0795e95-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How the Court’s opinion may be applied in other contexts is not entirely clear to me. . . . My uncertainty as to the reach of the opinion, and my fear that it purports to decide a great deal more than is necessary to dispose of this case, persuade me merely to concur in the judgment.</p>
<p id="c0795e96-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan, J.,</span> concurring and dissenting.</p>
<p id="c0795e97-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I join Parts I-III of the Court’s opinion. I fully agree that the minimum contacts analysis developed in <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i> represents a far more sensible construct for the exercise of state court jurisdiction than the patchwork of legal and factual fictions that has been generated from the decision in <i>Pennoyer v. Neff.</i> It is precisely because the inquiry into minimum contacts is now of such overriding importance, however, that I must respectfully dissent from Part IV of the Court’s opinion. . . . </p>
<p id="c0795e98-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I, therefore, would approach the minimum contacts analysis differently than does the Court. Crucial to me is the fact that appellants voluntarily associated themselves with the State of Delaware, “invoking the benefits and protections of its laws,” <i>Hanson v. Denckla</i>; <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>, by entering into a long term and fragile relationship with one of its domestic corporations. They thereby elected to assume powers and to undertake responsibilities wholly derived from that State’s rules and regulations, and to become eligible for those benefits that Delaware law makes available to its corporations’ officials. E.g., 8 Del. C. §§143 (interest-free loans); 145 (indemnification). While it is possible that countervailing issues of judicial efficiency and the like might clearly favor a different forum, they do not appear on the meager record before us; and, of course, we are concerned solely with “minimum” contacts, not the “best” contacts. I thus do not believe that it is unfair to insist that appellants make themselves available to suit in a competent forum that Delaware might create for vindication of its important public policies directly pertaining to appellants’ fiduciary associations with the State.</p>

<p id="c07985bf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>In rem</i> jurisdiction, an old idea, and the Internet, a newer one, have come together in an interesting way. Like other trademarks, Internet domain names are valuable pieces of intellectual property, and legislation protects them from various sorts of abuse and poaching. Because of the ease of registering a domain name and the ubiquity of the Internet, plaintiffs seeking to protect domain names sometimes have difficulty in locating the defendant. Even if the defendant’s whereabouts are known, the defendant may not be subject to personal jurisdiction in the United States. Congress responded with the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (15 U.S.C. §1125(d)(2) (2011)), whose procedural portions exploit the architecture of the Internet and the concept of <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction. Individual computers connected to the Internet have numerical addresses. But long strings of numbers are more difficult to remember than, for example, google.com, so the Internet uses a domain name system, which is a table of names associated with computer addresses. Whenever an Internet user requests a domain name site by typing its name in a browser, its numerical address has to be matched with a number by searching a list acquired from directory computers that maintain lists matching site names with numerical <span title="99" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-99">p. 99</span>addresses. The domain name registrar keeps the most current tables matching names and numbers. The registrar thus functions both as a keeper of title records and as a continually updated directory that facilitates the matching process that allows the Internet to function.</p>

In more recent cases, the Supreme Court has struggled with how to apply the concepts of <i>International Shoe</i> and shown some restlessness with its doctrinal categories. The Court’s restlessness raises a question that you should consider as you work through the intricacies of modern jurisdictional doctrine: Does the current doctrinal framework make sense?</p>

<p id="c079ace5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents Harry and Kay Robinson purchased a new Audi automobile from petitioner Seaway Volkswagen, Inc. (Seaway) in Massena, N.Y., in 1976. The following year the Robinson family, who resided in New York, left that State for a new home in Arizona. As they passed through the State of Oklahoma, another car struck their Audi in the rear, causing a fire which severely burned Kay Robinson and her two children.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10829_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10829_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span> The Robinsons subsequently brought a products-liability action in the District Court for Creek County, Okla. claiming that their injuries resulted from defective design and placement of the Audi’s gas tank and fuel system. They joined as defendants the automobile’s manufacturer, Audi NSU Auto Union Aktiengesellschaft (Audi); its importer, Volkswagen of America, Inc. (Volkswagen); its regional distributor, petitioner World-Wide Volkswagen Corporation (World-Wide); and its retail dealer, petitioner Seaway. Seaway and World-Wide entered special appearances,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1082F_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1082F_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">3</a></span> claiming that Oklahoma’s exercise of jurisdiction over them would offend the limitations on the State’s jurisdiction imposed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="c079d3f8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts presented to the District Court showed that World-Wide is incorporated and has its business office in New York. It distributes vehicles, parts and accessories, under contract with Volkswagen, to retail dealers in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Seaway, one of these retail dealers, is incorporated and has its place of business in New York. Insofar as the record reveals, Seaway and World-Wide are fully independent corporations whose relations with each other and with Volkswagen and Audi are contractual only. Respondents adduced no evidence that either World-Wide or Seaway does any business in Oklahoma, ships or sells any products to or in that State, has an agent to receive process there, or purchases advertisements in any media calculated to reach Oklahoma. In fact, as respondents’ counsel conceded at oral argument, there was no showing that any automobile sold by World-Wide or <span title="101" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-101">p. 101</span>Seaway has ever entered Oklahoma with the single exception of the vehicle involved in the present case. . . . </p>

<p id="c079d3fa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court of Oklahoma denied the writ. . . . The Court’s rationale was contained in the following paragraph:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c079d3fb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case before us, the product being sold and distributed by the petitioners is by its very design and purpose so mobile that petitioners can foresee its possible use in Oklahoma. This is especially true of the distributor, who has the exclusive right to distribute such automobile in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The evidence presented below demonstrated that goods sold and distributed by the petitioners were used in the State of Oklahoma, and under the facts we believe it reasonable to infer, given the retail value of the automobile, that the petitioners derive substantial income from automobiles which from time to time are used in the State of Oklahoma. This being the case, we hold that under the facts presented, the trial court was justified in concluding that the petitioners derive substantial revenue from goods used or consumed in this State.</p>

<p id="c079d3fe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . As has long been settled, and as we reaffirm today, a state court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only so long as there exist “minimum contacts” between the defendant and the forum State. <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>. The concept of minimum contacts, in turn, can be seen to perform two related, but distinguishable functions. It protects the defendant against the burdens of litigating in a distant or inconvenient forum. And it acts to ensure that the States, through their courts, do not reach out beyond the limits imposed on them by their status as coequal sovereigns in a federal system.</p>
<p id="c079d3ff-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The protection against inconvenient litigation is typically described in terms of “reasonableness” or “fairness.” We have said that the defendant’s contacts with the forum State must be such that maintenance of the suit “does not offend ’traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’” <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>, quoting <i>Milliken v. Meyer</i>. The relationship between the defendant and the forum must be such that it is “reasonable  . . . to require the corporation to defend the particular suit which is brought there.” Implicit in this emphasis on reasonableness is the understanding that the burden on the defendant, while always a primary concern, will in an appropriate case be considered in light of other relevant factors, including the forum State’s interest in adjudicating the dispute; the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, at least when that interest is not adequately protected by the plaintiff’s power to choose the forum, cf. <i>Shaffer v. Heitner</i>; the interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies; and <span title="102" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-102">p. 102</span>the shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.</p>
<p id="c079d400-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The limits imposed on state jurisdiction by the Due Process Clause, in its role as a guarantor against inconvenient litigation, have been substantially relaxed over the years. As we noted in <i>McGee v. International Life Ins. Co</i>., this trend is largely attributable to a fundamental transformation in the American economy. . . . </p>
<p id="c079d401-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The historical developments noted in <i>McGee,</i> of course, have only accelerated in the generation since that case was decided. Nevertheless, we have never accepted the proposition that state lines are irrelevant for jurisdictional purposes, nor could we and remain faithful to the principles of interstate federalism embodied in the Constitution. The economic interdependence of the States was foreseen and desired by the Framers. In the Commerce Clause, they provided that the Nation was to be a common market, a “free trade unit” in which the States are debarred from acting as separable economic entities. But the Framers also intended that the States retain many essential attributes of sovereignty, including, in particular, the sovereign power to try causes in their courts.</p>
<p id="c079d402-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sovereignty of each State, in turn, implied a limitation on the sovereignty of all of its sister States—a limitation express or implicit in both the original scheme of the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . </p>
<p id="c079d403-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the Due Process Clause “does not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment in personam against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts, ties, or relations.” <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>. Even if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another State; even if the forum State has a strong interest in applying its law to the controversy; even if the forum State is the most convenient location for litigation, the Due Process Clause, acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment. <i>Hanson v. Denckla</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c079fa14-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">III</p></div>
<p id="c079fa15-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying these principles to the case at hand, we find in the record before us a total absence of those affiliating circumstances that are a necessary predicate to any exercise of state-court jurisdiction. Petitioners carry on no activity whatsoever in Oklahoma. They close no sales and perform no services there. They avail themselves of none of the privileges and benefits of Oklahoma law. They solicit no business there either through salespersons or through advertising reasonably calculated to reach the State. Nor does the record show that they regularly sell cars at wholesale or retail to Oklahoma customers or residents or that they indirectly, through others, serve or seek to serve the Oklahoma market. In short, respondents seek to base jurisdiction on one, isolated occurrence and whatever inferences can be drawn therefrom: the fortuitous circumstance that a single Audi automobile, sold in New York to New York residents, happened to suffer an accident while passing through Oklahoma.</p>
<p id="c079fa16-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is argued, however, that because an automobile is mobile by its very design and purpose it was “foreseeable” that the Robinsons’ Audi would cause injury in Oklahoma. Yet “foreseeability” alone has never been a sufficient benchmark for <span title="103" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-103">p. 103</span>personal jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause. In <i>Hanson v. Denckla</i>, supra, it was no doubt foreseeable that the settlor of a Delaware trust would subsequently move to Florida and seek to exercise a power of appointment there; yet we held that Florida courts could not constitutionally exercise jurisdiction over a Delaware trustee that had no other contacts with the forum State. . . . </p>
<p id="c079fa17-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If foreseeability were the criterion, a local California tire retailer could be forced to defend in Pennsylvania when a blowout occurs there; a Wisconsin seller of a defective automobile jack could be haled before a distant court for damage caused in New Jersey; or a Florida soft drink concessionaire could be summoned to Alaska to account for injuries happening there. Every seller of chattels would in effect appoint the chattel his agent for service of process. His amenability to suit would travel with the chattel. We recently abandoned the outworn rule of <i>Harris v. Balk</i>, that the interest of a creditor in a debt could be extinguished or otherwise affected by any State having transitory jurisdiction over the debtor. <i>Shaffer v. Heitner</i>. Having interred the mechanical rule that a creditor’s amenability to a quasi in rem action travels with his debtor, we are unwilling to endorse an analogous principle in the present case.</p>
<p id="c079fa18-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not to say, of course, that foreseeability is wholly irrelevant. But the foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis is not the mere likelihood that a product will find its way into the forum State. Rather, it is that the defendant’s conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there. The Due Process Clause, by ensuring the “orderly administration of the laws,” gives a degree of predictability to the legal system that allows potential defendants to structure their primary conduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit.</p>
<p id="c079fa19-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a corporation “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State,” it has clear notice that it is subject to suit there, and can act to alleviate the risk of burdensome litigation by procuring insurance, passing the expected costs on to customers, or, if the risks are too great, severing its connection with the State. Hence if the sale of a product of a manufacturer or distributor such as Audi or Volkswagen is not simply an isolated occurrence, but arises from the efforts of the manufacturer or distributor to serve, directly or indirectly, the market for its product in other States, it is not unreasonable to subject it to suit in one of those States if its allegedly defective merchandise has there been the source of injury to its owner or to others. The forum State does not exceed its powers under the Due Process Clause if it asserts personal jurisdiction over a corporation that delivers its products into the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers in the forum State. Cf. <i>Gray v. American Radiator</i>.</p>
<p id="c079fa1a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But there is no such or similar basis for Oklahoma jurisdiction over World-Wide or Seaway in this case. Seaway’s sales are made in Massena, N.Y. World-Wide’s market, although substantially larger, is limited to dealers in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. There is no evidence of record that any automobiles distributed by World-Wide are sold to retail customers outside this tri-State area. It is foreseeable that the purchasers of automobiles sold by World-Wide and Seaway may take them to Oklahoma. But the mere “unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a <span title="104" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-104">p. 104</span>nonresident defendant cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State.” <i>Hanson v. Denckla</i>.</p>
<p id="c079fa1b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a variant on the previous argument it is contended that jurisdiction can be supported by the fact that petitioners earn substantial revenue from goods used in Oklahoma. The Oklahoma Supreme Court so found, drawing the inference that because one automobile sold by petitioners had been used in Oklahoma, others might have been used there also. While this inference seems less than compelling on the facts of the instant case, we need not question the Court’s factual findings in order to reject its reasoning.</p>
<p id="c079fa1c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This argument seems to make the point that the purchase of automobiles in New York, from which the petitioners earn substantial revenue, would not occur but for the fact that the automobiles are capable of use in distant States like Oklahoma. Respondents observe that the very purpose of an automobile is to travel, and that travel of automobiles sold by petitioners is facilitated by an extensive chain of Volkswagen service centers throughout the Country, including some in Oklahoma.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108CB_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N108CB_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">12</a></span> However, financial benefits accruing to the defendant from a collateral relation to the forum State will not support jurisdiction if they do not stem from a constitutionally cognizable contact with that State. In our view, whatever marginal revenues petitioners may receive by virtue of the fact that their products are capable of use in Oklahoma is far too attenuated a contact to justify that State’s exercise of in personam jurisdiction over them.</p>
<p id="c079fa1e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because we find that petitioners have no “contacts, ties, or relations” with the State of Oklahoma, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma is reversed.</p>

Although both sell automobiles within limited sales territories, each sold the automobile which in fact was driven to Oklahoma where it was involved in an accident.

But obviously these were unrealistic hopes that <span title="105" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-105">p. 105</span>cannot be treated as an automatic constitutional shield.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108F6_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N108F6_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">9</a></span> An automobile simply is not a stationary item or one designed to be used in one place. An automobile is intended to be moved around. Someone in the business of selling large numbers of automobiles can hardly plead ignorance of their mobility or pretend that the automobiles stay put after they are sold. It is not merely that a dealer in automobiles foresees that they will move. The dealer actually intends that the purchasers will use the automobiles to travel to distant States where the dealer does not directly “do business.” The sale of an automobile does <i>purposefully</i> inject the vehicle into the stream of interstate commerce so that it can travel to distant States. . . . </p>
<p id="c07a2135-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court accepts that a State may exercise jurisdiction over a distributor which “serves” that State “indirectly” by “deliver[ing] its products into the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will [be] purchased by consumers in other States.” It is difficult to see why the Constitution should distinguish between a case involving goods which reach a distant State through a chain of distribution and a case involving goods which reach the same State because a consumer, using them as the dealer knew the customer would, took them there. In each case the seller purposefully injects the goods into the stream of commerce and those goods predictably are used in the forum State. . . . </p>

Seaway and World-Wide could “foresee” that their cars might end up in Oklahoma, or for that matter in any part of the world with paved roads connected to those in upstate New York, where Seaway was located; after all, cars are <i>supposed</i> to be mobile—that’s why advertisements show them zooming along open highways. Not enough, says the majority. Looking back to <i>Hanson v. Denkla</i>, the Court says the local dealer and the regional distributor did not purposefully avail themselves—did not seek out, by advertising or in other ways—the Oklahoma market, so jurisdiction does not lie. By contrast, the opinion suggests, though does not hold (because the issue was not presented), that the manufacturer and the national distributor did avail themselves—by buying advertising and establishing dealerships—of the Oklahoma market.</p></li>
<li><p id="c07a484e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Also notice a pattern present here and in most of the other cases in this chapter: A state court—here the Oklahoma Supreme Court—first applies what it understands to be existing constitutional doctrine. That is where most personal jurisdiction cases end: with a state court applying existing doctrine. Out of the hundreds of such state court decisions—all interpreting and applying the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution, only a minute proportion will ever be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court, although in theory all could be. Here the U.S. Supreme Court does grant review and decides that the Oklahoma court did not correctly apply the doctrine. Its analysis will now become part of the accumulating doctrine that both state and federal courts will apply when considering questions of personal jurisdiction.</p></li>

<p id="c07a4854-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hence if the sale of a product of a manufacturer or distributor such as Audi or Volkswagen is not simply an isolated occurrence, but arises from the efforts of the manufacturer or distributor to serve, directly or indirectly, the market for its product in other States, it is not unreasonable to subject it to suit in one of those States if its allegedly defective merchandise there has been the source of injury to others. . . . </p>

Before leaving on the trip to Arizona, they went to a Massena, N.Y., retailer who specialized in sound equipment for cars and purchased a sound system for the Audi. The system was manufactured in Japan and sold all over the United States. The national distributor was located in California. Further assume that the cause of the car fire was traced to defective wiring in the sound system. If the Robinsons sue in Oklahoma, naming the Massena retailer, the Japanese manufacturer, and the California distributor, who will be subject to personal jurisdiction?</p></li>

Suppose Audi had discovered a gas tank problem and sent a service bulletin to Seaway and World-Wide requiring them to correct the problem—but they had failed to do so. Their failure to correct the defect would not be a defense in the Robinsons’ actions against Audi, but it might be the basis for requiring Seaway and World-Wide to indemnify Audi. Under these circumstances, Audi, after paying a judgment to the Robinsons, would have to sue Seaway and World-Wide separately, probably in New York. But because World-Wide and Seaway would not have been parties to the Oklahoma litigation, they would not be bound by the finding of a product defect. The result might be inconsistent judgments—Oklahoma holding Audi responsible for a design defect, but New York courts finding that there was no defect and that Audi was therefore not entitled to indemnity.</p></li>

<p id="c07a6f69-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Personal jurisdiction motions are strategic tools in a defendant’s arsenal, and therefore something plaintiffs must anticipate. In theory, a successful motion to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction only delays the suit: At least as to a U.S. defendant, there will be some jurisdiction (permanent domicile, state of incorporation) where suit can be brought. So why do defendants bother?</p>
<p id="c07a6f6a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a marginal case, the suit might go away entirely. The statute of limitations in the new forum state may have run. Or, unlike the Robinsons’ case, which involved very serious permanent injuries, there could be a much lower damage bill. Plaintiff’s lawyer has to locate a competent practitioner in another state and arrange for her to take over the case, a process involving some expense. If witnesses have to travel, the added expense might make bringing the suit irrational.</p>
<p id="c07a6f6b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the case persists, the defendant has done two things. He’s delayed the date at which he may have to pay damages (in many tort suits interest does not run until judgment is entered). And he’s moved the case to a different forum, which, for reasons having nothing to do with jurisdiction, may be friendlier.</p>
<p id="c07a6f6c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But plaintiffs too can behave strategically. Modern jurisdictional doctrine often permits plaintiff a choice of several fora in which to sue. In <i>World-Wide</i>, <span title="108" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-108">p. 108</span>the plaintiffs could have sued Audi in New York, in Oklahoma, and perhaps in Arizona, where the Robinsons were moving on their ill-fated trip. The plaintiffs’ lawyer doubtless considered which of these fora would be most sympathetic to their case.</p>
<p id="c07a6f6d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In fact, <i>World-Wide Volkswagen</i> displays both sides maneuvering for strategic advantage by deploying jurisdictional doctrine. Reading the case, you may have wondered why the driver of the car that collided with the plaintiffs did not seem to be in the case, and why the plaintiffs bothered to name the local dealer and regional distributor as defendants in a product design defect case. Professor Charles Adams, who has looked into the story behind the case in World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson—<i>The Rest of the Story</i>, 72 Neb. L. Rev. 1122 (1993), provides an account that may answer the first of these questions:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c07a6f6e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lloyd Hull knew he had a serious drinking problem. Ever since his retirement from the Navy two years before, it seemed as though he needed to get a little high, or better, every day. After getting off work on September 21, 1977, in Berryville, Arkansas, Lloyd was on his way to visit his older sister in Okarche, Oklahoma. Next to the bottle of Jim Beam on the front seat was a loaded .22 Magnum pistol for shooting jack rabbits on his sister’s farm. . . . </p>

<p id="c07a9682-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And why did the Robinsons name the New York dealer and regional distributor? The answer may lie in where the parties would want the case to be tried. Start with the plaintiff, who has the initial choice. Why did the Robinsons’ lawyer choose Oklahoma? According to Professor Adams, Creek County, Oklahoma, where the crash had occurred, was “a blue collar community that. . . . [had] become known to personal injury lawyers throughout the state as being particularly sympathetic to personal injury plaintiffs.” Id. at 1128.</p>
<p id="c07a9683-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But a successful strategy to try the case in Creek County would not only have to bring it there but keep it there. As you will see in the next chapter, noncitizen defendants may “remove” to federal court an action if the requisites of diversity have been met. Any good plaintiff’s lawyer would know that if he sued a German manufacturer and its national distributor (located in Michigan), the defendants could remove the case to a federal district court by invoking diversity jurisdiction. Since the federal district court nearest to Creek County is in Tulsa, and since that court would draw its jurors from a number of counties in the Eastern District of Oklahoma, the defendants could, by making such a move, dilute what plaintiff hoped would be a favorable jury pool.</p>
<p id="c07a9684-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Could the plaintiff prevent such removal? For diversity jurisdiction to exist, none of the defendants can be of the same state as the plaintiffs (a principle explored more fully in the next chapter). The Robinsons’ lawyer argued that the Robinsons, although they were on their way to Arizona, remained New York citizens until <span title="109" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-109">p. 109</span>they had permanently settled in their new home. Hence the importance of naming World-Wide and Seaway, both New York corporations, as defendants: So long as they remained in the lawsuit, the case could not be removed to federal court and would therefore be tried before a Creek County jury.</p>
<p id="c07a9685-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants’ counter was the motion to dismiss the two New York defendants for want of personal jurisdiction. Do you now understand why there was such a fierce battle about personal jurisdiction over two apparently irrelevant defendants?</p>
<p id="c07a9686-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given this background, what would you expect to be the remaining defendants’ next procedural move after the case has been sent back to Oklahoma courts with the holding that there is no jurisdiction over Seaway and World-Wide?</p>

<li class=""><p id="c07abd97-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Five years after <i>World-Wide</i>, the Court decided Burger King v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462 (1985). Burger King sells franchises for its fast food outlets to investors. To establish quality control and national brand uniformity Burger King requires its franchisees to adhere to a number of standards, including attendance at “Burger King University” in Miami, Florida, where franchise owners are trained in creating a uniform product. John Rudzewicz (a partner in a national accounting firm) and Brian MacShara, an acquaintance—both Michigan residents—applied to take over an existing Burger King franchise in a Detroit suburb. The Florida headquarters approved the application and MacShara, who was to supervise day-to-day operations, thereafter trained in Florida. When the franchise began to lose money and the partners fell behind in their payments, Burger King terminated the franchise and brought suit in Florida, invoking federal diversity jurisdiction. Rudzewicz and MacShara challenged the personal jurisdiction of the Florida district court, arguing that the franchise was in Michigan, and that their limited contact with Florida did not support jurisdiction over this claim. The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that by entering into a long-term agreement with a corporation known to be based in Florida, in a contract that called for the application of Florida law, and training in Florida, the partners had purposefully availed themselves of Florida law—enough to warrant the exercise of Florida jurisdiction over them in a suit seeking to enforce terms of the franchise agreement. In the process the majority opinion, written by Justice Brennan, enunciated principles that Brennan had espoused in other opinions (including his dissents in <i>Shaffer</i> and <i>World-Wide Volkswagen</i>) but had never previously won the day.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c07abd98-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once it has been decided that a defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum State, these contacts may be considered in light of other factors to determine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with “fair play and substantial justice.” <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>. Thus courts in “appropriate [cases]” may evaluate “the burden on the defendant,” “the forum State’s interest in adjudicating the dispute,” “the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,” “the interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,” and the “shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.” <i>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson</i>. These considerations sometimes serve <span title="110" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-110">p. 110</span>to establish the reasonableness of jurisdiction upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts than would otherwise be required. On the other hand, where a defendant who purposefully has directed his activities at forum residents seeks to defeat jurisdiction, he must present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.</p>

This view of personal jurisdiction is a break from earlier cases: The Supreme Court’s majority opinions up until this point focused almost exclusively on whether there were sufficient “minimum contacts” between the defendant and the forum state without paying more than lip service to considerations of “fair play and substantial justice.” Justice Brennan’s analysis has neither found an echo in later cases nor been explicitly repudiated.</p>

If we assume the distributor is well capitalized or insured, plaintiff could collect a judgment from either. But not all distributors are solvent. In the next case, a tort plaintiff faced a national distributor who, after selling the allegedly defective product, went bankrupt. The question was whether the plaintiff could obtain jurisdiction over the manufacturer. In <i>World-Wide Volkswagen,</i> the manufacturer thought the answer was sufficiently self-evident that it did not challenge jurisdiction. In the next case, the manufacturer did challenge personal jurisdiction—and prevailed.</p></li>

<p id="c07b0bc9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the Supreme Court of New Jersey, relying in part on <i>Asahi</i>, held that New Jersey’s courts can exercise jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer of a product so long as the manufacturer “knows or reasonably should know that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to those products being sold in any of the fifty states.” Applying that test, the court concluded that a British manufacturer of scrap metal machines was subject to jurisdiction in New Jersey, even though at no time had it advertised in, sent goods to, or in any relevant sense targeted the State.</p>
<p id="c07b0bca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That decision cannot be sustained. . . . As a general rule, the exercise of judicial power is not lawful unless the defendant “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.” Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253 (1958). There may be exceptions, say, for instance, in cases involving an intentional tort. But the general rule is applicable in this products-liability case, and the so-called “stream-of-commerce” doctrine cannot displace it.</p>

Robert Nicastro seriously injured his hand while using a metal-shearing machine manufactured by J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (J. McIntyre). The accident occurred in New Jersey, but the machine was manufactured in England, where J. McIntyre is incorporated and operates. The question here is whether the New Jersey courts have jurisdiction over J. McIntyre, notwithstanding the fact that the company at no time either marketed goods in the State or shipped them there.</p>
<p id="c07b0bcd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At oral argument in this Court, Nicastro’s counsel stressed three primary facts in defense of New Jersey’s assertion of jurisdiction over J. McIntyre.</p>
<p id="c07b0bce-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, an independent company agreed to sell J. McIntyre’s machines in the United States. J. McIntyre itself did not sell its machines to buyers in this country beyond the U.S. distributor, and there is no allegation that the distributor was under J. McIntyre’s control.</p>
<p id="c07b32df-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, J. McIntyre officials attended annual conventions for the scrap recycling industry to advertise J. McIntyre’s machines alongside the distributor. The conventions took place in various States, but never in New Jersey.</p>
<p id="c07b32e0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, no more than four machines, including the machine that caused the injuries that are the basis for this suit, ended up in New Jersey.</p>
<p id="c07b32e1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to these facts emphasized by respondent, the New Jersey Supreme Court noted that. . . . the U.S. distributor “structured [its] advertising and sales efforts in accordance with” J. McIntyre’s “direction and guidance whenever possible,” and that “at least some of the machines were sold on consignment to” the distributor. . . . </p>
<p id="c07b32e2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of these facts, the New Jersey Supreme Court concluded that New Jersey courts could exercise jurisdiction over petitioner. . . . </p>
<p id="c07b32e3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court’s <i>Asahi</i> decision [described below] may be responsible in part for [the New Jersey] court’s error regarding the stream of commerce, and this case presents an opportunity to provide greater clarity.</p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c07b32e4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">II</p></div>
<p id="c07b32e5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court may subject a defendant to judgment only when the defendant has sufficient contacts with the sovereign “such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend ’traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’” International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940)). Freeform notions of fundamental fairness divorced from traditional practice cannot transform a judgment rendered in the absence of authority into law. As a general rule, the sovereign’s exercise of power requires some act by which the defendant “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws,” <i>Hanson</i>, though in some cases, as with an intentional tort, the defendant might well fall within the State’s authority by reason of his attempt to obstruct its laws. In products-liability cases like this one, it is the defendant’s purposeful availment that makes jurisdiction consistent with “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.”</p>
<p id="c07b32e6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A person may submit to a State’s authority in a number of ways. There is, of course, explicit consent. Presence within a State at the time suit commences <span title="113" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-113">p. 113</span>through service of process is another example. See <i>Burnham</i> [casebook page 148]. Citizenship or domicile—or, by analogy, incorporation or principal place of business for corporations—also indicates general submission to a State’s powers. <i>Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown</i> [casebook page 129]. Each of these examples reveals circumstances, or a course of conduct, from which it is proper to infer an intention to benefit from and thus an intention to submit to the laws of the forum State. Cf. <i>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz</i> [casebook page 109]. These examples support exercise of the general jurisdiction of the State’s courts and allow the State to resolve both matters that originate within the State and those based on activities and events elsewhere. By contrast, those who live or operate primarily outside a State have a due process right not to be subjected to judgment in its courts as a general matter.</p>
<p id="c07b32e7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is also a more limited form of submission to a State’s authority for disputes that “arise out of or are connected with the activities within the state.” <i>International Shoe Co</i>. Where a defendant “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws,” <i>Hanson</i>, it submits to the judicial power of an otherwise foreign sovereign to the extent that power is exercised in connection with the defendant’s activities touching on the State. In other words, submission through contact with and activity directed at a sovereign may justify specific jurisdiction “in a suit arising out of or related to the defendant’s contacts with the forum.”</p>
<p id="c07b32e8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The imprecision arising from <i>Asahi</i>, for the most part, results from its statement of the relation between jurisdiction and the “stream of commerce.” The stream of commerce, like other metaphors, has its deficiencies as well as its utility. It refers to the movement of goods from manufacturers through distributors to consumers, yet beyond that descriptive purpose its meaning is far from exact. This Court has stated that a defendant’s placing goods into the stream of commerce “with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers within the forum State” may indicate purposeful availment. <i>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson</i> (finding that expectation lacking). But that statement does not amend the general rule of personal jurisdiction. It merely observes that a defendant may in an appropriate case be subject to jurisdiction without entering the forum—itself an unexceptional proposition—as where manufacturers or distributors “seek to serve” a given State’s market. The principal inquiry in cases of this sort is whether the defendant’s activities manifest an intention to submit to the power of a sovereign. In other words, the defendant must “purposefully avai[l] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.” <i>Hanson</i>; Insurance Corp. [of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. at 704-05 (1982)] (“[A]ctions of the defendant may amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of the court”). Sometimes a defendant does so by sending its goods rather than its agents. The defendant’s transmission of goods permits the exercise of jurisdiction only where the defendant can be said to have targeted the forum; as a general rule, it is not enough that the defendant might have predicted that its goods will reach the forum State.</p>
<p id="c07b32e9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Asahi</i>, an opinion by Justice Brennan for four Justices outlined a different approach. It discarded the central concept of sovereign authority in favor of considerations of fairness and foreseeability. As that concurrence contended, “jurisdiction <span title="114" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-114">p. 114</span>premised on the placement of a product into the stream of commerce [without more] is consistent with the Due Process Clause,” for “[a]s long as a participant in this process is aware that the final product is being marketed in the forum State, the possibility of a lawsuit there cannot come as a surprise.” It was the premise of the concurring opinion that the defendant’s ability to anticipate suit renders the assertion of jurisdiction fair. In this way, the opinion made foreseeability the touchstone of jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="c07b59fa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The standard set forth in Justice Brennan’s concurrence was rejected in an opinion written by Justice O’Connor; but the relevant part of that opinion, too, commanded the assent of only four Justices, not a majority of the Court. That opinion stated: “The ’substantial connection’ between the defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding of minimum contacts must come about by an action of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State. The placement of a product into the stream of commerce, without more, is not an act of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State.” Id., at 112 (emphasis deleted; citations omitted).</p>
<p id="c07b59fb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since <i>Asahi</i> was decided, the courts have sought to reconcile the competing opinions. But Justice Brennan’s concurrence, advocating a rule based on general notions of fairness and foreseeability, is inconsistent with the premises of lawful judicial power. This Court’s precedents make clear that it is the defendant’s actions, not his expectations, that empower a State’s courts to subject him to judgment. . . . </p>
<p id="c07b59fc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two principles are implicit in the foregoing. First, personal jurisdiction requires a forum-by-forum, or sovereign-by-sovereign, analysis. The question is whether a defendant has followed a course of conduct directed at the society or economy existing within the jurisdiction of a given sovereign, so that the sovereign has the power to subject the defendant to judgment concerning that conduct. Personal jurisdiction, of course, restricts “judicial power not as a matter of sovereignty, but as a matter of individual liberty,” for due process protects the individual’s right to be subject only to lawful power. But whether a judicial judgment is lawful depends on whether the sovereign has authority to render it.</p>
<p id="c07b59fd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second principle is a corollary of the first. Because the United States is a distinct sovereign, a defendant may in principle be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States but not of any particular State. This is consistent with the premises and unique genius of our Constitution. Ours is “a legal system unprecedented in form and design, establishing two orders of government, each with its own direct relationship, its own privity, its own set of mutual rights and obligations to the people who sustain it and are governed by it.” For jurisdiction, a litigant may have the requisite relationship with the United States Government but not with the government of any individual State. That would be an exceptional case, however. If the defendant is a domestic domiciliary, the courts of its home State are available and can exercise general jurisdiction. And if another State were to assert jurisdiction in an inappropriate case, it would upset the federal balance, which posits that each State has a sovereignty that is not subject to unlawful intrusion by other States. Furthermore, foreign corporations will often target or concentrate on particular States, subjecting them to specific jurisdiction in those forums.</p>
<p id="c07b59fe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It must be remembered, however, that although this case and <i>Asahi</i> both involve foreign manufacturers, the undesirable consequences of Justice Brennan’s approach <span title="115" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-115">p. 115</span>are no less significant for domestic producers. The owner of a small Florida farm might sell crops to a large nearby distributor, for example, who might then distribute them to grocers across the country. If foreseeability were the controlling criterion, the farmer could be sued in Alaska or any number of other States’ courts without ever leaving town. And the issue of foreseeability may itself be contested so that significant expenses are incurred just on the preliminary issue of jurisdiction. Jurisdictional rules should avoid these costs whenever possible.</p>
<p id="c07b59ff-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The conclusion that the authority to subject a defendant to judgment depends on purposeful availment, consistent with Justice O’Connor’s opinion in <i>Asahi</i>, does not by itself resolve many difficult questions of jurisdiction that will arise in particular cases. The defendant’s conduct and the economic realities of the market the defendant seeks to serve will differ across cases, and judicial exposition will, in common-law fashion, clarify the contours of that principle.</p>

<p id="c07b5a01-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, petitioner directed marketing and sales efforts at the United States. It may be that, assuming it were otherwise empowered to legislate on the subject, the Congress could authorize the exercise of jurisdiction in appropriate courts. That circumstance is not presented in this case, however, and it is neither necessary nor appropriate to address here any constitutional concerns that might be attendant to that exercise of power. Nor is it necessary to determine what substantive law might apply were Congress to authorize jurisdiction in a federal court in New Jersey. A sovereign’s legislative authority to regulate conduct may present considerations different from those presented by its authority to subject a defendant to judgment in its courts. Here the question concerns the authority of a New Jersey state court to exercise jurisdiction, so it is petitioner’s purposeful contacts with New Jersey, not with the United States, that alone are relevant.</p>
<p id="c07b5a02-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent has not established that J. McIntyre engaged in conduct purposefully directed at New Jersey. . . . Indeed, after discovery the trial court found that the “defendant does not have a single contact with New Jersey short of the machine in question ending up in this state.” These facts may reveal an intent to serve the U.S. market, but they do not show that J.

At no time did petitioner engage in any activities in New Jersey that reveal an intent to invoke or benefit from the protection of its laws. New Jersey is without power to adjudge the rights and liabilities of J. McIntyre, and its exercise of jurisdiction would violate due process. The contrary judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court is <i>Reversed</i>.</p>

<p id="c07b8116-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court of New Jersey adopted a broad understanding of the scope of personal jurisdiction based on its view that “[t]he increasingly fast-paced globalization of the world economy has removed national borders as barriers to trade.” I do not doubt that there have been many recent changes in commerce and communication, <span title="116" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-116">p. 116</span>many of which are not anticipated by our precedents. But this case does not present any of those issues. So I think it unwise to announce a rule of broad applicability without full consideration of the modern-day consequences.</p>
<p id="c07b8117-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, the outcome of this case is determined by our precedents. Based on the facts found by the New Jersey courts, respondent Robert Nicastro failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that it was constitutionally proper to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (British Manufacturer), a British firm that manufactures scrap-metal machines in Great Britain and sells them through an independent distributor in the United States (American Distributor). On that basis, I agree with the plurality that the contrary judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey should be reversed. . . . </p>

Alleging that the machine was a dangerous product defectively made, Nicastro sought compensation from the machine’s manufacturer, J. McIntyre Machinery Ltd. (McIntyre UK). Established in 1872 as a United Kingdom corporation, and headquartered in Nottingham, England, McIntyre UK “designs, develops and manufactures a complete range of equipment for metal recycling.” The company’s product line, as advertised on McIntyre UK’s Web site, includes “metal shears, balers, cable and can recycling equipment, furnaces, casting equipment and. . . . the world’s best aluminum dross processing and cooling system.” McIntyre UK holds both United States and European patents on its technology.</p>
<p id="c07b8125-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The machine that injured Nicastro, a “McIntyre Model 640 Shear,” sold in the United States for $24,900 in 1995, and features a “massive cutting capacity.” According to McIntyre UK’s product brochure, the machine is “use[d] throughout the [w]orld.” McIntyre UK represented in the brochure that, by “incorporat[ing] off-the-shelf hydraulic parts from suppliers with international sales outlets,” the 640 Shear’s design guarantees serviceability “wherever [its customers] may be based.” The instruction manual advises “owner[s] and operators of a 640 Shear [to] make themselves aware of [applicable health and safety regulations],” including “the American National Standards Institute Regulations (USA) for the use of Scrap Metal Processing Equipment.”</p>

These annual expositions were held in diverse venues across the United States; in addition to Las Vegas, conventions were held 1990-2005 in New Orleans, Orlando, San Antonio, and San Francisco. McIntyre UK’s president, Michael Pownall, regularly attended ISRI conventions. He attended ISRI’s Las Vegas convention the year CSM’s owner first learned of, and saw, the 640 Shear. McIntyre UK exhibited its products at ISRI trade shows, the company acknowledged, hoping to reach “anyone interested in the machine from anywhere in the United States.”</p>
<p id="c07ba839-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although McIntyre UK’s U.S. sales figures are not in the record, it appears that for several years in the 1990’s, earnings from sales of McIntyre UK products in the United States “ha[d] been good” in comparison to “the rest of the world.” In response to interrogatories, McIntyre UK stated that its commissioning engineer had installed the company’s equipment in several States—Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Virginia, and Washington.</p>
<p id="c07ba83a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From at least 1995 until 2001, McIntyre UK retained an Ohio-based company, McIntyre Machinery America, Ltd. (McIntyre America), “as its exclusive distributor for the entire United States.” Though similarly named, the two companies were separate and independent entities with “no commonality of ownership or management.” In invoices and other written communications, McIntyre America described itself as McIntyre UK’s national distributor, “America’s Link” to “Quality Metal Processing Equipment” from England.</p>
<p id="c07ba83b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a November 23, 1999 letter to McIntyre America, McIntyre UK’s president spoke plainly about the manufacturer’s objective in authorizing the exclusive distributorship: “All we wish to do is sell our products in the [United] States—and get paid!” Notably, McIntyre America was concerned about U.S. litigation involving McIntyre UK products, in which the distributor had been named as a defendant. McIntyre UK counseled McIntyre America to respond personally to the litigation, but reassured its distributor that “the product was built and designed by McIntyre Machinery in the UK and the buck stops here—if there’s something wrong with the machine.”</p>
<p id="c07ba83c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the years, McIntyre America distributed several McIntyre UK products to U.S. customers, including, in addition to the 640 Shear, McIntyre UK’s “Niagara” and “Tardis” systems, wire strippers, and can machines. In promoting McIntyre UK’s products at conventions and demonstration sites and in trade journal advertisements, McIntyre America looked to McIntyre UK for direction and guidance. To achieve McIntyre UK’s objective, <i>i.e.,</i> “to sell [its] machines to customers throughout the United States,” “the two companies [were acting] closely in concert with each other.” McIntyre UK never instructed its distributor to avoid certain States or regions of the country; rather, as just noted, the manufacturer engaged McIntyre America to attract customers “from anywhere in the United States.”</p>
<p id="c07ba83d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, McIntyre UK’s regular attendance and exhibitions at ISRI conventions was surely a purposeful step to reach customers for its products “anywhere in the United States.” At least as purposeful was McIntyre UK’s engagement of McIntyre <span title="119" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-119">p. 119</span>America as the conduit for sales of McIntyre UK’s machines to buyers “throughout the United States.” Given McIntyre UK’s endeavors to reach and profit from the United States market as a whole, Nicastro’s suit, I would hold, has been brought in a forum entirely appropriate for the adjudication of his claim. He alleges that McIntyre UK’s shear machine was defectively designed or manufactured and, as a result, caused injury to him at his workplace. The machine arrived in Nicastro’s New Jersey workplace not randomly or fortuitously, but as a result of the U.S. connections and distribution system that McIntyre UK deliberately arranged.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BC1_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10BC1_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">3</a></span> On what sensible view of the allocation of adjudicatory authority could the place of Nicastro’s injury within the United States be deemed off limits for his products liability claim against a foreign manufacturer who targeted the United States (including all the States that constitute the Nation) as the territory it sought to develop?</p>

A foreign-country manufacturer engages a U.S. company to promote and distribute the manufacturer’s products, not in any particular State, but anywhere and everywhere in the United States the distributor can attract purchasers. The product proves defective and injures a user in the State where the user lives or works . . . . </p>

Is it not fair and reasonable, given the mode of trading of which this case is an example, to require the international seller to defend at the place its products cause injury? Do not litigational convenience and choice-of-law considerations point in that direction? On what measure of reason and fairness can it be considered undue to require McIntyre UK to defend in New Jersey as an incident of its efforts to develop a market for its industrial machines anywhere and everywhere in the United States? Is not the burden on McIntyre UK to defend in New Jersey fair, <i>i.e.</i>, a reasonable cost of transacting business internationally, in comparison to the burden on Nicastro to go to <span title="120" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-120">p. 120</span>Nottingham, England to gain recompense for an injury he sustained using McIntyre’s product at his workplace in Saddle Brook, New Jersey?</p>
<p id="c07ba843-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McIntyre UK dealt with the United States as a single market. Like most foreign manufacturers, it was concerned not with the prospect of suit in State X as opposed to State Y, but rather with its subjection to suit anywhere in the United States . . . . If McIntyre UK is answerable in the United States at all, is it not “perfectly appropriate to permit the exercise of that jurisdiction. . . . at the place of injury"?  . . . </p>

<li class=""><p id="c07ba848-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plurality opinion starts by saying that it hopes to clear up confusion created by the plurality opinion in a preceding case, <i>Asahi Metal</i>. It might have done so had the plurality been a majority. But, as Justice Ginsburg’s dissent points out, Justice Kennedy’s opinion got only four votes—another plurality. So the case stands for the proposition that six Justices thought that jurisdiction did not lie under the circumstances described—and that four of those six would reject the “foreseeability” principle set forth by four Justices in <i>Asahi</i>.</p>

They write: “There may well have been other facts that Mr. Nicastro could have demonstrated in support of jurisdiction.

<p id="c07bcf6b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Abdouch is a resident of Omaha, Nebraska. In 1960, Abdouch was the executive secretary of the Nebraska presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy. In 1963, <span title="122" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-122">p. 122</span>Abdouch received a copy of the book, which was inscribed to her by the late author Richard Yates. The inscription stated: “For Helen Abdouch—with admiration and best wishes. Dick Yates. 8/19/63.” At some time not specified by the record, Abdouch’s inscribed copy of the book was stolen. Lopez and his company, KLB, bought the book in 2009 from a seller in Georgia and sold it that same year to a customer not in Nebraska. In 2011, Abdouch, who does not own a computer, learned from a friend that Lopez had used the inscription in the book for advertising purposes on his Web site, http://www.lopezbooks.com. The commercial advertisement had been used with the word “SOLD” on the Web site for more than 3 years after the book was sold. The advertisement associated with a picture of the inscription stated in relevant part:</p>

<p id="c07bcf6c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This copy is <i>inscribed by Yates</i>: “For Helen Abdouch—with admiration and best wishes. Dick Yates. 8/19/63.” Yates had worked as a speech writer for Robert Kennedy when Kennedy served as Attorney General; Abdouch was the executive secretary of the Nebraska (John F.) Kennedy organization when Robert Kennedy was campaign manager. The book is cocked; the boards are stained; the text is clean. A very good copy in a near fine, spine-tanned dust jacket. A scarce book, and it is extremely uncommon to find this advance issue of it signed. Given the date of the inscription—that is, during JFK’s Presidency—and the connection between writer and recipient, it’s reasonable to suppose this was an author’s copy, presented to Abdouch by Yates.

<p id="c07bf67d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lopez is the owner and sole proprietor of KLB, which is a rare book business based in Hadley, Massachusetts. KLB buys and sells rare books and manuscripts. KLB sells these books and manuscripts through published catalogs and through the Web site. Generally, the Web site contains KLB’s inventory of rare books and manuscripts. Individuals that visit the Web site can browse and search the inventory. If individuals or entities choose to, they can purchase through the Web site.</p>

Over the past 25 years, Lopez and/or KLB have attended and exhibited at an estimated 300 to 400 bookfairs in various locations within the United States, as well as overseas. Lopez and KLB have never exhibited at or attended a book fair in Nebraska.</p>
<p id="c07bf67f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">KLB has an active mailing list for its catalogs of approximately 1,000 individuals and entities. Among that list, only two are located in Nebraska. According to Lopez’ affidavit, KLB did not solicit the two Nebraska members; rather, the two individuals solicited contact with KLB and requested to be placed on the mailing list. Neither of these two individuals has any connection to the claims at issue in this lawsuit.</p>
<p id="c07bf680-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neither Lopez nor KLB is registered to do business in Nebraska in any capacity.

In 2010, KLB sold three books to two Nebraska customers for $239.87. In 2011, two books were sold to a Nebraska customer for $299.

<p id="c07bf68c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Internet and its interaction with personal jurisdiction over a nonresident is an issue of first impression for this court. . . . [T]he Eighth Circuit, as well as the majority of circuits, has adopted the analytical framework set forth in <i>Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com., Inc</i>., for internet jurisdiction cases. In that case, Zippo Manufacturing Company [which made cigarette lighters] filed a complaint in Pennsylvania against nonresident Zippo Dot Com, Inc.[, a news service], alleging causes of action under the federal Trademark Act of 1946. Zippo Dot Com’s contact with Pennsylvania consisted of over 3,000 Pennsylvania residents subscribing to its Web site. The district court in <i>Zippo Mfg. Co.</i> famously created a “sliding scale” test that considers a Web site’s interactivity and the nature of the commercial activities conducted over the Internet to determine whether the courts have personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants. The court in <i>Zippo Mfg. Co.</i> explained the “sliding scale” as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c07c1d9d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At one end of the spectrum are situations where a defendant clearly does business over the Internet. If the defendant enters into contracts with residents of a foreign jurisdiction that involve the knowing and repeated transmission of computer files over the Internet, personal jurisdiction is proper. . . . At the opposite end are situations where a defendant has simply posted information on an Internet Web site which is accessible to users in foreign jurisdictions. A passive Web site that does little more than make information available to those who are interested in it is not grounds for the exercise [of] personal jurisdiction. . . . The middle ground is occupied by interactive Web sites where a user can exchange information with the host computer. In these cases, the exercise of jurisdiction is determined by examining the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information that occurs on the Web site.</p>
</div>
<p id="c07c1d9e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court held that Pennsylvania had personal jurisdiction over Zippo Dot Com and the causes of action. In doing so, the district court made two important findings. First, the district court found that the Zippo Dot Com Web site was a highly interactive commercial Web site. Second, and more important, the district court found that the trademark infringement causes of action were related to the business contacts with customers in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p id="c07c1d9f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case at hand, it is evident that the Web site is interactive under the <i>Zippo Mfg. Co.</i> sliding scale test. In his affidavit, Lopez admits that customers can browse and purchase books from the online inventory. Lopez admits that he has two customers in Nebraska who are on the mailing list for KLB’s catalogs. He admits that from 2009 through 2011, a total of $614.87 in sales from the Web site was made to Nebraska residents out of an estimated $3.9 million in total sales.</p>
<p id="c07c1da0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But, beyond the minimal Web site sales to Nebraska residents and mailing catalogs to two Nebraska residents, Lopez’ and KLB’s contacts with Nebraska are nonexistent. Lopez and KLB do not own, lease, or rent land in Nebraska. They have never advertised directly in Nebraska, participated in bookfairs in Nebraska, or attended meetings in Nebraska, and neither has paid sales tax in Nebraska.</p>
<p id="c07c1da1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, the Seventh Circuit has recently stated that when “the plaintiff’s claims are for intentional torts, the inquiry focuses on whether the conduct underlying <span title="125" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-125">p. 125</span>the claims was purposely directed at the forum state.” The reason for requiring purposeful direction is to “’ensure that an out-of-state defendant is not bound to appear to account for merely “random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts” with the forum state.’” Here, Abdouch’s cause of action is an intentional tort based on Nebraska’s privacy statute. There is no evidence, as discussed in greater detail later in the opinion, that Lopez and KLB purposefully directed the advertisement at Nebraska. Further, there is no evidence that Lopez and KLB intended to invade Abdouch’s privacy in the State of Nebraska. Rather, the limited Internet sales appear to be random, fortuitous, and attenuated contacts with Nebraska.</p>
<p id="c07c1da2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Therefore, although Lopez and KLB’s Web site is highly interactive, all of the contacts created by the Web site with the State of Nebraska are unrelated to Abdouch’s cause of action.</p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c07c1da3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">B. <i>Calder</i> Effects Test</p></div>
<p id="c07c1da4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Abdouch argues that the effects test formulated by the U.S. Supreme Court in <i>Calder v. Jones</i> creates personal jurisdiction over Lopez and KLB, because Lopez and KLB aimed their tortious conduct at Abdouch and the State of Nebraska. In <i>Calder,</i> two Florida residents participated in the publication of an article about a California resident who brought a libel action in California against the Florida residents. Both defendants asserted that as Florida residents, they were not subject to the jurisdiction of the California court in which the libel action was filed. The Supreme Court rejected the defendants’ argument and noted that the defendants were not charged with mere untargeted negligence. Rather, their intentional, and allegedly tortious, actions were expressly aimed at California. Petitioner[s] wrote and. . . . edited an article that they knew would have a potentially devastating impact upon respondent. And they knew that the brunt of that injury would be felt by respondent in the State in which she lives and works and in which the National Enquirer [where the article was published] has its largest circulation. Under the circumstances, petitioners must “reasonably anticipate being haled into court there” to answer for the truth of the statements made in their article.</p>
<p id="c07c1da5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In coming to its holding, the U.S. Supreme Court created a test, now known as the <i>Calder</i> effects test, which has been explained by the Eighth Circuit [in <i>Johnson v. Arden</i>]:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c07c1da6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“[A] defendant’s tortious acts can serve as a source of personal jurisdiction only where the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing that the defendant’s acts (1) were intentional, (2) were uniquely or expressly aimed at the forum state, and (3) caused harm, the brunt of which was suffered—and which the defendant knew was likely to be suffered—[in the forum state].”</p>
</div>
<p id="c07c1da7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Third Circuit has noted that the effects test “can only be satisfied if the plaintiff can point to contacts which demonstrate that the defendant <i>expressly aimed</i> its tortious conduct at the forum, and thereby made the forum the focal point of the tortious activity.” Stated another way by the Third Circuit, “the effects test asks whether the plaintiff felt the brunt of the harm in the forum state, but it also asks <span title="126" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-126">p. 126</span>whether defendants <i>knew</i> that the plaintiff would suffer the harm there and whether they <i>aimed</i> their tortious conduct at that state.” Similarly, the Eighth Circuit has stated that the <i>Calder</i> effects test “allows the assertion of personal jurisdiction over non-resident defendants whose acts ’are performed for the very purpose of having their consequences felt in the forum state.’”</p>
<p id="c07c44b8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . Lopez and KLB’s placement of the advertisement online was directed at the entire world, without expressly aiming the posting at the State of Nebraska. Abdouch pleaded in her complaint that the advertisement was “’broadcast’ or sent out over the world wide web,” but Abdouch failed to plead facts that demonstrate that Nebraska residents were targeted with the advertisement. Although the advertisement does mention that “Abdouch was the executive secretary of the Nebraska (John F.) Kennedy organization,” the advertisement does not expressly direct its offer of sale to Nebraska. As in <i>Johnson,</i> the mention of Nebraska here is incidental and was not included for the purposes of having the consequences felt in Nebraska. . . . Lopez did not know that Abdouch was a resident of Nebraska. He assumed that she had passed away and thus had no way of knowing that the brunt of harm would be suffered in Nebraska. Abdouch’s complaint fails to demonstrate that Lopez and KLB had an intent to target and focus on Nebraska residents . . . . </p>

<p id="c07c44ba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that Abdouch’s complaint fails to plead facts to demonstrate that Lopez and KLB have sufficient minimum contacts with the State of Nebraska. Although the Web site used to post the advertisement is interactive, the contacts created by the Web site are unrelated to Abdouch’s cause of action. Furthermore, under the <i>Calder</i> effects test, the pleadings fail to establish that Lopez and KLB expressly aimed their tortious conduct at the State of Nebraska. For these reasons, Lopez and KLB could not have anticipated being haled into a Nebraska court for their online advertisement.</p>

<ul class="">
<li><p id="c07c44bd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Doctrinally, <i>Abdouch</i> displays a court applying <i>International Shoe</i> to a new domain—the Internet. One of the virtues of <i>International Shoe</i>’s open-ended formulation is that it enables courts to apply it to new contexts. One of its vices is that each new context will require courts to think through the analogies to other cases and situations.</p></li>
<li><p id="c07c44be-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Abdouch</i> displays a state court, rather than the U.S. Supreme Court, working with familiar jurisdictional doctrine. Most civil litigation occurs in state courts. Because the Due Process Clause addresses itself to states, most challenges to personal jurisdiction will be decided in state courts, with the U.S. Supreme Court granting review only occasionally. But for the most part the system <span title="127" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-127">p. 127</span>assumes that state courts will faithfully apply constitutional doctrine.

The court finds that the Internet site is interactive, yet concludes that there is no personal jurisdiction over the defendant in Nebraska. Why?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c07c6bd3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second line draws on cases, including <i>Calder</i>, in which a defendant takes some action in State <i>A</i> that has effects in State <i>B</i>. (The classic example is standing by the state line and throwing a rock at someone in the adjacent state.) According to this line of cases, the knowledge of where the effect will occur and the intent to cause that effect will support jurisdiction. So far as you can judge, what facts would have had to be different to support a finding of jurisdiction in Nebraska?</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class=""><p id="c07c6bd4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Zippo</i> interactivity test has been criticized for asking not quite the right question.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c07c6bd5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One criticism of the <i>Zippo</i> test is that the Internet operates differently now than it did in 1997, when <i>Zippo</i> was decided. “Virtually all websites. . . . are now interactive in nature” and most “also interact with the user ’behind the scenes’ through the use of ’cookies.’ Thus, even a website that appears ’passive in nature may actually be interacting with the user’s data and custom-tailoring the content based on the user’s identity, demographics, browsing history, and personal preferences.” Kindig It Design, Inc. v. Creative Controls, Inc., 157 F. Supp. 3d 1167 (D. Utah 2016).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c07c6bd6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some have argued that the focus should not be on the extent of interactivity, but rather the features of the site that demonstrate purposeful availment of the benefits and protections of the state. According to this criticism, a site that was intensely interactive—allowing visitors to post comments and pictures, and play games, for example—might nevertheless fail to support jurisdiction if the creator of the site did not target users in the state. Conversely, a very modestly interactive site on which shoppers could order and pay for products—that in the process ascertained the address and contact information for users—would support jurisdiction for claims arising out of those orders. Persuasive?</p></li>

Fiore, 134 S. Ct. 1115 (2014). Gina Fiore and her companion were professional gamblers. Returning from a gambling trip to Puerto Rico, they were carrying hand luggage containing $97,000 in cash, their gambling “bank” and winnings. While in the process of changing planes in Atlanta to board a flight to Nevada, they were questioned by federal Drug Enforcement Agents who seized the funds as suspected proceeds of drug trafficking. Fiore’s Nevada attorney contacted the DEA and submitted various forms of evidence supporting the claim that the funds were derived from gambling, not narcotics. While these conversations were going on, Walden, the agent who had first seized the cash, drafted an allegedly false affidavit supporting an effort to have the money forfeited as the proceeds of drug sales. Fiore filed suit in federal court for the District of Nevada, alleging violations of constitutionally protected rights and seeking damages. Defendant challenged the assertion of personal jurisdiction over him, pointing out that the seizure had occurred in Georgia and defendant had no contacts with Nevada. Plaintiff countered that at the time the false affidavit was drafted, defendant knew that his action would affect her in Nevada (because he knew that was one of her residences) and that such knowledge sufficed. No, held a unanimous Court: “A forum State’s exercise of jurisdiction over an out-of-state intentional tortfeasor must be based on intentional contact by the defendant that creates the necessary contacts with the forum.” The opinion sought to distinguish <i>Calder v. Jones</i>, described above in <i>Abdouch</i>. In <i>Calder</i>, the <i>Fiore</i> Court pointed out, it wasn’t just the plaintiff’s California residence that mattered, but the phone calls to California sources for the story and the substantial sales of the tabloid in California. In <i>Fiore</i>, by contrast, the only link to Nevada was the defendant’s knowledge that Nevada was one of the states in which plaintiff resided—not enough.</p></li>

<p id="c07c92ea-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cases in the previous section all concern the relationship to the forum state necessary to support specific jurisdiction. For example, <i>Burger King</i> holds that Florida had jurisdiction to hear a lawsuit against Mr. Rudzewicz arising out of his dealings with Burger King. The case does not stand for the proposition that Florida could hear a lawsuit brought by Mr. Rudzewicz’s Michigan neighbor claiming that his tree roots had clogged the neighbor’s drains, or a suit by an Iowa motorist claiming that Rudzewicz had collided with her on a Colorado road.</p>
<p id="c07c92eb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under what circumstances will defendant be subject to jurisdiction for all claims—even those without any connection to the forum state? In passing, <i>International Shoe</i> suggests that, at least for U.S. defendants, there will always be a state in which suit may be brought on all claims. For corporations, the state of incorporation will be such a forum; so will the state that is the principal place of business (if different from the state of incorporation). General Motors (GM), incorporated in Delaware and with its principal place of business in Michigan, may be sued in either of those states even for claims unrelated to its activities there. Thus an Oregon automobile owner claiming injuries due to a defectively designed GM vehicle could sue <span title="129" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-129">p. 129</span>in either Michigan or Delaware. That would be true even if the vehicle had been manufactured at a GM plant in Texas, Mexico, or Germany.</p>
<p id="c07c92ec-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A similar situation holds true for individuals. As already noted, <i>Milliken v. Meyer</i> (supra page 78) stands for the proposition that individuals can be sued in the state of their domicile for all claims. Thus a resident of Michigan could be sued there for claims arising out of an auto accident that occurred while he was vacationing in Colorado.</p>
<p id="c07c92ed-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The states of domicile (for individuals) and incorporation and principal place of business (for corporations) comprise the easy instances of general jurisdiction, instances where defendants are being sued in what is self-evidently their “base of operations.” In the next two cases, the Supreme Court considers whether and under what circumstances the principle of general jurisdiction extends beyond these limited bounds: not very far, it appears.</p>

<p id="c07cba03-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case concerns the jurisdiction of state courts over corporations organized and operating abroad. We address, in particular, this question: Are foreign subsidiaries of a United States parent corporation amenable to suit in state court on claims unrelated to any activity of the subsidiaries in the forum State?</p>
<p id="c07cba04-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A bus accident outside Paris that took the lives of two 13-year-old boys from North Carolina gave rise to the litigation we here consider. Attributing the accident to a defective tire manufactured in Turkey at the plant of a foreign subsidiary of The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company (Goodyear USA), the boys’ parents commenced an action for damages in a North Carolina state court; they named as defendants Goodyear USA, an Ohio corporation, and three of its subsidiaries, organized and operating, respectively, in Turkey, France, and Luxembourg. Goodyear USA, which had plants in North Carolina and regularly engaged in commercial activity there, did not contest the North Carolina court’s jurisdiction over it; Goodyear USA’s foreign subsidiaries, however, maintained that North Carolina lacked adjudicatory authority over them.</p>
<p id="c07cba05-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A state court’s assertion of jurisdiction exposes defendants to the State’s coercive power, and is therefore subject to review for compatibility with the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>. Opinions in the wake of the pathmarking <i>International Shoe</i> decision have differentiated between general or all-purpose jurisdiction, and specific or case-linked jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="c07cba06-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court may assert general jurisdiction over foreign (sister-state or foreign-country) corporations to hear any and all claims against them when their affiliations with the State are so “continuous and systematic” as to render them essentially at home in the forum State. Specific jurisdiction, on the other hand, depends on an “affiliatio[n] between the forum and the underlying controversy,” principally, activity or an occurrence that takes <span title="130" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-130">p. 130</span>place in the forum State and is therefore subject to the State’s regulation. von Mehren &amp; Trautman, Jurisdiction to Adjudicate: A Suggested Analysis, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 1121, 1136 (1966) (hereinafter von Mehren &amp; Trautman); see Brilmayer et al., A General Look at General Jurisdiction, 66 Texas L. Rev. 721, 782 (1988) (hereinafter Brilmayer). In contrast to general, all-purpose jurisdiction, specific jurisdiction is confined to adjudication of “issues deriving from, or connected with, the very controversy that establishes jurisdiction.” von Mehren &amp; Trautman 1136.</p>
<p id="c07cba07-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the episode-in-suit, the bus accident, occurred in France, and the tire alleged to have caused the accident was manufactured and sold abroad, North Carolina courts lacked specific jurisdiction to adjudicate the controversy. The North Carolina Court of Appeals so acknowledged. Were the foreign subsidiaries nonetheless amenable to general jurisdiction in North Carolina courts? Confusing or blending general and specific jurisdictional inquiries, the North Carolina courts answered yes. Some of the tires made abroad by Goodyear’s foreign subsidiaries, the North Carolina Court of Appeals stressed, had reached North Carolina through “the stream of commerce”; that connection, the Court of Appeals believed, gave North Carolina courts the handle needed for the exercise of general jurisdiction over the foreign corporations.</p>
<p id="c07cba08-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A connection so limited between the forum and the foreign corporation, we hold, is an inadequate basis for the exercise of general jurisdiction. . . . </p>
<p id="c07cba09-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Endeavoring to give specific content to the “fair play and substantial justice” concept, the Court in <i>International Shoe</i> classified cases involving out-of-state corporate defendants. First, as in <i>International Shoe</i> itself, jurisdiction unquestionably could be asserted where the corporation’s in-state activity is “continuous and systematic” and <i>that activity gave rise to the episode-in-suit</i>. Further, the Court observed, the commission of certain “single or occasional acts” in a State may be sufficient to render a corporation answerable in that State with respect to those acts, though not with respect to matters unrelated to the forum connections. The heading courts today use to encompass these two <i>International Shoe</i> categories is “specific jurisdiction.” See von Mehren &amp; Trautman 1144-1163. Adjudicatory authority is “specific” when the suit “aris[es] out of or relate[s] to the defendant’s contacts with the forum.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c07cba0a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In only two decisions postdating <i>International Shoe</i> has this Court considered whether an out-of-state corporate defendant’s in-state contacts were sufficiently “continuous and systematic” to justify the exercise of general jurisdiction over claims unrelated to those contacts: Perkins v. Benguet Consol.

<p id="c07cba0c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To justify the exercise of general jurisdiction over petitioners, the North Carolina courts relied on the petitioners’ placement of their tires in the “stream of commerce.” The stream-of-commerce metaphor has been invoked frequently in lower court decisions <span title="131" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-131">p. 131</span>permitting “jurisdiction in products liability cases in which the product has traveled through an extensive chain of distribution before reaching the ultimate consumer.” 18 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations §8640.40, p. 133 (rev. ed. 2007). Typically, in such cases, a nonresident defendant, acting <i>outside</i> the forum, places in the stream of commerce a product that ultimately causes harm <i>inside</i> the forum. . . . </p>
<p id="c07cba0d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The North Carolina court’s stream-of-commerce analysis elided the essential difference between case-specific and all-purpose (general) jurisdiction. Flow of a manufacturer’s products into the forum, we have explained, may bolster an affiliation germane to <i>specific</i> jurisdiction. See, e.g., <i>World-Wide Volkswagen</i> (where “the sale of a product. . . . is not simply an isolated occurrence, but arises from the efforts of the manufacturer or distributor to serve. . . . the market for its product in [several] States, it is not unreasonable to subject it to suit in one of those States if its allegedly defective merchandise <i>has there been the source of injury to its owner or to others</i>” (emphasis added)). But ties serving to bolster the exercise of specific jurisdiction do not warrant a determination that, based on those ties, the forum has <i>general</i> jurisdiction over a defendant. . . . </p>
<p id="c07ce11e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A corporation’s “continuous activity of some sorts within a state,” <i>International Shoe</i> instructed, “is not enough to support the demand that the corporation be amenable to suits unrelated to that activity.” Our 1952 decision in <i>Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co</i>. remains “[t]he textbook case of general jurisdiction appropriately exercised over a foreign corporation that has not consented to suit in the forum.”</p>
<p id="c07ce11f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sued in Ohio, the defendant in <i>Perkins</i> was a Philippine mining corporation that had ceased activities in the Philippines during World War II. To the extent that the company was conducting any business during and immediately after the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, it was doing so in Ohio: the corporation’s president maintained his office there, kept the company files in that office, and supervised from the Ohio office “the necessarily limited wartime activities of the company.” Although the claim-in-suit did not arise in Ohio, this Court ruled that it would not violate due process for Ohio to adjudicate the controversy. . . . </p>
<p id="c07ce120-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Measured against <i>Helicopteros</i> and <i>Perkins</i>, North Carolina is not a forum in which it would be permissible to subject petitioners to general jurisdiction. Unlike the defendant in <i>Perkins</i>, whose sole wartime business activity was conducted in Ohio, petitioners are in no sense at home in North Carolina. Their attenuated connections to the State, fall far short of the “the continuous and systematic general business contacts” necessary to empower North Carolina to entertain suit against them on claims unrelated to anything that connects them to the State. <i>Helicopteros</i>, 466 U.S., at 416, 104 S.

Recall that of the four defendants, the only ones challenging jurisdiction were three Goodyear subsidiary corporations—one each in France, Luxembourg, and Turkey. Although some of the products of each of these corporations reached North Carolina, explain why that did not suffice to give the North Carolina court specific jurisdiction.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c07d083a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What difference does this decision make to the plaintiffs’ case? The parent company, Goodyear USA, did not challenge personal jurisdiction so they are before the court. But, under the law of most states only the entity that designed, manufactured, marketed, and distributed the product would be liable, not the parent, unless the plaintiffs could show that the subsidiary was not truly operated as a separate corporation.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c07d083b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So unless the plaintiffs could obtain jurisdiction over the foreign subsidiary in the United States they could not pursue their claim in the United States. (They could, of course, sue abroad, but that would mean forgoing a jury trial, and most other nations’ discovery rules are substantially more limited than in the United States.)</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c07d083c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suing outside the United States also has many collateral difficulties. A few examples: Most other countries bar the contingent fee, so hiring a lawyer could be difficult; many countries limit wrongful death damages to a much greater extent than in the United States; collecting a judgment can be more difficult than it is in the United States; and in many nations the loser pays the winner’s attorneys’ fees—making the bringing of a less-than-certain claim a risky proposition.</p></li>

</li>
<li class=""><p id="c07d083d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You will regularly see case-law references to general jurisdiction. But, as Prof. Mary Twitchell argues in the article cited in the opinion, most of those references come in cases in which a court says something resembling that said in <i>Goodyear</i>: There’s no specific jurisdiction in this case and, though plaintiff argues valiantly, there’s no general jurisdiction either. One can see this pattern at work in the next case, in which the plaintiffs ignored the subsidiaries and took direct aim at the parent. A word of introduction about the federal statute that formed the basis for the substantive claim may help. The Alien <span title="133" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-133">p. 133</span>Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. §1350, grants jurisdiction to the federal courts for “civil action[s] by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.” Enacted in 1789, apparently out of the embarrassed discovery that the young federal courts lacked jurisdiction to hear a civil claim arising out of an assault on a diplomat by a foreign national, the statute lacks both a clarifying legislative history or much case law. In recent decades, it served as a vehicle for those seeking to redress abuses of human rights occurring outside the United States. The Supreme Court limited the reach of the Alien Tort Statute in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 133 S. Ct. 1659 (2013) (invoking presumption that U.S. statutes were not intended to have extra-territorial reach). The next case creates an additional barrier to liability under the Alien Tort Statute based in its analysis of the scope of general jurisdiction.</p></li>

<p id="c07d2f53-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case concerns the authority of a court in the United States to entertain a claim brought by foreign plaintiffs against a foreign defendant based on events occurring entirely outside the United States. . . . In <i>Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v.

As to the former, we held that a court may assert jurisdiction over a foreign corporation “to hear any and all claims against [it]” only when the corporation’s affiliations with the State in which suit is brought are so constant and pervasive “as to render [it] essentially at home in the forum State.” Instructed by <i>Goodyear</i>, we conclude Daimler is not “at home” in California, and cannot be sued there for injuries plaintiffs attribute to MB Argentina’s conduct in Argentina.</p>

<p id="c07d2f55-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2004, plaintiffs (respondents here) filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that MB Argentina collaborated with Argentinian state security forces to kidnap, detain, torture, and kill plaintiffs and their relatives during the military dictatorship in place there from 1976 through 1983, a period known as Argentina’s “Dirty War.” Based on those allegations, plaintiffs asserted claims under the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. §1350, and the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, note following 28 U.S.C. §1350, as well as claims for wrongful death and intentional infliction of emotional distress under the laws of California and Argentina. The incidents recounted in the complaint center on MB Argentina’s plant in Gonzalez Catan, Argentina; no part of MB Argentina’s alleged collaboration with Argentinian authorities took place in California or anywhere else in the United States.</p>

Plaintiffs seek to hold Daimler vicariously liable for MB Argentina’s alleged malfeasance. Daimler is a German <i>Aktiengesellschaft</i> (public stock company) that manufactures Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Germany and has its headquarters in Stuttgart. At times relevant to this case, MB Argentina was a subsidiary wholly owned by Daimler’s predecessor in interest.</p>
<p id="c07d2f57-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Daimler moved to dismiss the action for want of personal jurisdiction.

Although MBUSA’s principal place of business is in New Jersey, MBUSA has multiple California-based facilities, including a regional office in Costa Mesa, a Vehicle Preparation Center in Carson, and a Classic Center in Irvine. According to the record developed below, MBUSA is the largest supplier of luxury vehicles to the California market. In particular, over 10% of all sales of new vehicles in the United States take place in California, and MBUSA’s California sales account for 2.4% of Daimler’s worldwide sales.</p>
<p id="c07d2f5a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The relationship between Daimler and MBUSA is delineated in a General Distributor Agreement, which sets forth requirements for MBUSA’s distribution of Mercedes-Benz vehicles in the United States.

<p id="c07d7c8c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Goodyear</i> made clear that only a limited set of affiliations with a forum will render a defendant amenable to all-purpose jurisdiction there. “For an individual, the paradigm forum for the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual’s domicile; for a corporation, it is an equivalent place, one in which the corporation is fairly regarded as at home.”. . . . (citing Brilmayer et al., A General Look at General Jurisdiction, 66 Texas L. Rev. 721, 728 (1988)). With respect to a corporation, the place of incorporation and principal place of business are “paradig[m]. . . . bases for general jurisdiction.”. . . . See also Twitchell, 101 Harv. L. Rev., at 633. Those affiliations have the virtue of being unique—that is, each ordinarily indicates only one place—as well as easily ascertainable. . . . </p>
<p id="c07d7c8d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Goodyear</i> did not hold that a corporation may be subject to general jurisdiction <i>only</i> in a forum where it is incorporated or has its principal place of business; it simply typed those places paradigm all-purpose forums.

<p id="c07d7c8e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, the inquiry under <i>Goodyear</i> is not whether a foreign corporation’s in-forum contacts can be said to be in some sense “continuous and systematic,” it is whether that corporation’s “affiliations with the State are so ’continuous and systematic’ as to render [it] essentially at home in the forum State.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1104A_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1104A_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">19</a></span>  . . . </p>

Such exorbitant exercises of all-purpose jurisdiction would scarcely permit out-of-state defendants “to structure their primary conduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c07d7c91-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It was therefore error for the Ninth Circuit to conclude that Daimler, even with MBUSA’s contacts attributed to it, was at home in California, and hence subject to suit there on claims by foreign plaintiffs having nothing to do with anything that occurred or had its principal impact in California.</p>

<p id="c07d7c93-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the transnational context of this dispute bears attention. . . . </p>
<p id="c07da3a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Ninth Circuit. . . . paid little heed to the risks to international comity its expansive view of general jurisdiction posed. Other nations do not share the uninhibited approach to personal jurisdiction advanced by the Court of Appeals in this case. In the European Union, for example, a corporation may generally be sued in the nation in which it is “domiciled,” a term defined to refer only to the location of the corporation’s “statutory seat,” “central administration,” or “principal place of business.” European Parliament and Council Reg. 1215/2012, Arts. 4(1), and 63(1), 2012 O. J. (L. 351) 7, 18. . . . The Solicitor General informs us, in this regard, that “foreign governments’ objections to some domestic courts’ expansive views of general jurisdiction have in the past impeded negotiations of international agreements on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments.”. . . . Considerations of international rapport thus reinforce our determination that subjecting Daimler to the general jurisdiction of courts in California would not accord with the “fair play and substantial justice” due process demands. . . . </p>
<p id="c07da3a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is</p>
<p id="c07da3a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reversed.</p>
<p id="c07da3a7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span class="epub-small-caps">Sotomayor, J.,</span> concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="c07da3a8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with the Court’s conclusion that the Due Process Clause prohibits the exercise of personal jurisdiction over Daimler in light of the unique circumstances of this case. I concur only in the judgment, however, because I cannot agree with the path the Court takes to arrive at that result.</p>
<p id="c07da3a9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court acknowledges that Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA), Daimler’s wholly owned subsidiary, has considerable contacts with California. It has multiple facilities in the State, including a regional headquarters. Each year, it distributes in California tens of thousands of cars, the sale of which generated billions of dollars in the year this suit was brought. And it provides service and sales support to customers throughout the State. Daimler has conceded that California courts may exercise general jurisdiction over MBUSA on the basis of these contacts, and the Court assumes that MBUSA’s contacts may be attributed to Daimler for the purpose of deciding whether Daimler is also subject to general jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="c07da3aa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="138" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-138">p. 138</span>Are these contacts sufficient to permit the exercise of general jurisdiction over Daimler? The Court holds that they are not, for a reason wholly foreign to our due process jurisprudence. The problem, the Court says, is not that Daimler’s contacts with California are too few, but that its contacts with other forums are too many. In other words, the Court does not dispute that the presence of multiple offices, the direct distribution of thousands of products accounting for billions of dollars in sales, and continuous interaction with customers throughout a State would be enough to support the exercise of general jurisdiction over some businesses. Daimler is just not one of those businesses, the Court concludes, because its California contacts must be viewed in the context of its extensive “nationwide and worldwide” operations. In recent years, Americans have grown accustomed to the concept of multinational corporations that are supposedly “too big to fail”; today the Court deems Daimler “too big for general jurisdiction.”</p>
<p id="c07da3ab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s conclusion is wrong as a matter of both process and substance. As to process, the Court decides this case on a ground that was neither argued nor passed on below, and that Daimler raised for the first time in a footnote to its brief. As to substance, the Court’s focus on Daimler’s operations outside of California ignores the lodestar of our personal jurisdiction jurisprudence: A State may subject a defendant to the burden of suit if the defendant has sufficiently taken advantage of the State’s laws and protections through its contacts in the State; whether the defendant has contacts elsewhere is immaterial.</p>
<p id="c07da3ac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Regrettably, these errors are unforced. The Court can and should decide this case on the far simpler ground that, no matter how extensive Daimler’s contacts with California, that State’s exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable given that the case involves foreign plaintiffs suing a foreign defendant based on foreign conduct, and given that a more appropriate forum is available. Because I would reverse the judgment below on this ground, I concur in the judgment only. . . . </p>

<li class=""><p id="c07dcac3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To see what the case does and does not stand for, imagine that the plaintiff was a California resident injured in a Mercedes-Benz auto in Los Angeles and that the plaintiff alleged that a defect in the design or manufacture of the car caused his injuries. Assuming that MBUSA’s actions are attributable to Daimler AG (the German parent company), as it was assumed in <i>Daimler</i>, the plaintiff would be able to establish personal jurisdiction over both MBUSA and Daimler AG in California. Why? Why is this factual scenario distinguishable from <i>Daimler AG v. Bauman</i>?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c07dcac4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After <i>Goodyear</i> and <i>Daimler</i> when, if ever, will a corporate defendant be “at home” in a state other than that of its principal place of business or state of incorporation? Consider a hypothetical suit against Boeing Aircraft, incorporated in Delaware. For many decades, Boeing’s headquarters was in the State of Washington, and almost all of its manufacturing operations occurred in Washington, where it was considered to be a core employer. It has now relocated its headquarters to Chicago, Illinois, but the bulk of its manufacturing operations continue to occur in Washington. Suppose there was an air crash involving a Boeing plane not manufactured in Washington, with suit brought in that state. Might Boeing be sufficiently “at home” there to satisfy the court’s general jurisdiction test?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c07dcac5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Daimler</i> restates the proposition that a corporation will be subject to general jurisdiction in the state where it “has its principal place of business.” As you will see, that concept recurs in several contexts—(1) in personal jurisdiction; (2) in venue (treated later in this chapter); and (3) in the context of federal diversity jurisdiction (discussed in Chapter 3). As you will see, in the latter context the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the relevant diversity statute to define a corporation’s principal place of business as being the state where its “officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation’s activities.” Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 599 U.S. 77 (2010) (infra page 225). It would be lovely, would it not, for us to be able to report that the same test also controls in the case of personal jurisdiction and venue? But we cannot: There is no definitive ruling that the same phrase means the same thing in all three settings. Just as “citizen” may mean one thing for naturalization purposes, another for getting a driver’s license, and a third for in-state university tuition, it is possible that courts will give the same phrase somewhat different meanings in these contexts as well.</p></li>

<p id="c07df1df-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">BMS, a large pharmaceutical company, is incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in New York, and it maintains substantial operations in both New York and New Jersey. Over 50 percent of BMs’s work force in the United States is employed in those two States.</p>
<p id="c07df1e0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">BMS also engages in business activities in other jurisdictions, including California.

<p id="c07df1e1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the pharmaceuticals that BMS manufactures and sells is Plavix, a prescription drug that thins the blood and inhibits blood clotting. BMS did not develop Plavix in California, did not create a marketing strategy for Plavix in California, and did not manufacture, label, package, or work on the regulatory approval of the product in California. BMS instead engaged in all of these activities in either New York or New Jersey. But BMS does sell Plavix in California. Between 2006 and 2012, it sold almost 187 million Plavix pills in the State and took in more than $900 million from those sales. This amounts to a little over one percent of the company’s nationwide sales revenue.</p>

<p id="c07e18f3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A group of plaintiffs—consisting of 86 California residents and 592 residents from 33 other States—filed eight separate complaints in California Superior Court, alleging that Plavix had damaged their health. All the complaints asserted 13 claims under California law, including products liability, negligent misrepresentation, and misleading advertising claims. The nonresident plaintiffs did not allege that they obtained Plavix through California physicians or from any other California source; nor did they claim that they were injured by Plavix or were treated for their injuries in California.</p>
<p id="c07e18f4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Asserting lack of personal jurisdiction, BMS moved to quash service of summons on the nonresidents’ claims, but the California Superior Court denied this motion, finding that the California courts had general jurisdiction over BMS “[b]ecause [it] <span title="141" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-141">p. 141</span>engages in extensive activities in California.” BMS unsuccessfully petitioned the State Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate, but after our decision on general jurisdiction in <i>Daimler AG v. Bauman</i> [casebook page 133], the California Supreme Court instructed the Court of Appeal “to vacate its order denying mandate and to issue an order to show cause why relief sought in the petition should not be granted.”</p>
<p id="c07e18f5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeal then changed its decision on the question of general jurisdiction. Under <i>Daimler</i>, it held, general jurisdiction was clearly lacking, but it went on to find that the California courts had specific jurisdiction over the nonresidents’ claims against BMS.</p>
<p id="c07e18f6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The California Supreme Court affirmed. The court unanimously agreed with the Court of Appeal on the issue of general jurisdiction, but the court was divided on the question of specific jurisdiction. The majority applied a “sliding scale approach to specific jurisdiction.” Under this approach, “the more wide ranging the defendant’s forum contacts, the more readily is shown a connection between the forum contacts and the claim.” Applying this test, the majority concluded that “BMs’s extensive contacts with California” permitted the exercise of specific jurisdiction “based on a less direct connection between BMs’s forum activities and plaintiffs’ claims than might otherwise be required.” This attenuated requirement was met, the majority found, because the claims of the nonresidents were similar in several ways to the claims of the California residents (as to which specific jurisdiction was uncontested). The court noted that “[b]oth the resident and nonresident plaintiffs’ claims are based on the same allegedly defective product and the assertedly misleading marketing and promotion of that product.” And while acknowledging that “there is no claim that Plavix itself was designed and developed in [BMs’s California research facilities],” the court thought it significant that other research was done in the State.</p>

<p id="c07e18f9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has long been established that the Fourteenth Amendment limits the personal jurisdiction of state courts. . . . The primary focus of our personal jurisdiction inquiry is the defendant’s relationship to the forum State.</p>
<p id="c07e18fa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since our seminal decision in <i>International Shoe,</i> our decisions have recognized two types of personal jurisdiction: “general” (sometimes called “all-purpose”) jurisdiction and “specific” (sometimes called “case-linked”) jurisdiction. <i>Goodyear</i> [casebook page 129]. “For an individual, the paradigm forum for the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual’s domicile; for a corporation, it is an equivalent place, one in which the corporation is fairly regarded as at home.” <i>Id.</i> A court with general jurisdiction may hear <i>any</i> claim against that defendant, even if all the incidents underlying the claim occurred in a different State. But “only a limited set of affiliations with a forum will render a defendant amenable to” general jurisdiction in that State. <i>Daimler</i>.</p>
<p id="c07e18fb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Specific jurisdiction is very different. In order for a state court to exercise specific jurisdiction, “the <i>suit</i>” must “aris[e] out of or relat[e] to the defendant’s contacts with the <i>forum</i>.” <i>Id.</i> In other words, there must be “an affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, [an] activity or an occurrence that takes <span title="142" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-142">p. 142</span>place in the forum State and is therefore subject to the State’s regulation.” <i>Goodyear.</i> For this reason, “specific jurisdiction is confined to adjudication of issues deriving from, or connected with, the very controversy that establishes jurisdiction.” <i>Ibid. . . . </i></p>
<p id="c07e400c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining whether personal jurisdiction is present, a court must consider a variety of interests. These include “the interests of the forum State and of the plaintiff in proceeding with the cause in the plaintiff’s forum of choice.” But the “primary concern” is “the burden on the defendant.” Assessing this burden obviously requires a court to consider the practical problems resulting from litigating in the forum, but it also encompasses the more abstract matter of submitting to the coercive power of a State that may have little legitimate interest in the claims in question. As we have put it, restrictions on personal jurisdiction “are more than a guarantee of immunity from inconvenient or distant litigation. They are a consequence of territorial limitations on the power of the respective States.” <i>Hanson,</i> [casebook page 87]. “[T]he States retain many essential attributes of sovereignty, including, in particular, the sovereign power to try causes in their courts. The sovereignty of each State. . . . implie[s] a limitation on the sovereignty of all its sister States.” <i>World-Wide Volkswagen</i>, [casebook page 100]. And at times, this federalism interest may be decisive. As we explained in <i>World-Wide Volkswagen</i>, “[e]ven if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another State; even if the forum State has a strong interest in applying its law to the controversy; even if the forum State is the most convenient location for litigation, the Due Process Clause, acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment.”</p>

<p id="c07e400e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our settled principles regarding specific jurisdiction control this case. In order for a court to exercise specific jurisdiction over a claim, there must be an “affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, [an] activity or an occurrence that takes place in the forum State.” <i>Goodyear.</i> When there is no such connection, specific jurisdiction is lacking regardless of the extent of a defendant’s unconnected activities in the State.</p>
<p id="c07e400f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For this reason, the California Supreme Court’s “sliding scale approach” is difficult to square with our precedents. Under the California approach, the strength of the requisite connection between the forum and the specific claims at issue is relaxed if the defendant has extensive forum contacts that are unrelated to those claims. Our cases provide no support for this approach, which resembles a loose and spurious form of general jurisdiction. For specific jurisdiction, a defendant’s general connections with the forum are not enough. As we have said, “[a] corporation’s ’continuous activity of some sorts within a state. . . . is not enough to support the demand that the corporation be amenable to suits unrelated to that activity.’”</p>
<p id="c07e4010-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present case illustrates the danger of the California approach. The State Supreme Court found that specific jurisdiction was present without identifying any adequate link between the State and the nonresidents’ claims. As noted, the nonresidents were not prescribed Plavix in California, did not ingest Plavix in California, and were not injured by Plavix in California. The mere fact that <i>other</i> plaintiffs were prescribed, obtained, and ingested Plavix in California—and allegedly sustained the <span title="143" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-143">p. 143</span>same injuries as did the non-residents—does not allow the State to assert specific jurisdiction over the nonresidents’ claims . . . . Nor is it sufficient—or even relevant—that BMS conducted research in California on matters unrelated to Plavix. What is needed—and what is missing here—is a connection between the forum and the specific claims at issue . . . . </p>
<p id="c07e4011-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a last ditch contention, respondents contend that BMs’s “decision to contract with a California company [McKesson] to distribute [Plavix] nationally” provides a sufficient basis for personal jurisdiction. But as we have explained, “[t]he requirements of <i>International Shoe</i>. . . . must be met as to each defendant over whom a state court exercises jurisdiction.” In this case, it is not alleged that BMS engaged in relevant acts together with McKesson in California. Nor is it alleged that BMS is derivatively liable for McKesson’s conduct in California. And the nonresidents have adduced no evidence to show how or by whom the Plavix they took was distributed to the pharmacies that dispensed it to them. The bare fact that BMS contracted with a California distributor is not enough to establish personal jurisdiction in the State.</p>

<p id="c07e4013-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our straightforward application in this case of settled principles of personal jurisdiction will not result in the parade of horribles that respondents conjure up. Our decision does not prevent the California and out-of-state plaintiffs from joining together in a consolidated action in the States that have general jurisdiction over BMS. BMS concedes that such suits could be brought in either New York or Delaware. Alternatively, the plaintiffs who are residents of a particular State—for example, the 92 plaintiffs from Texas and the 71 from Ohio—could probably sue together in their home States. In addition, since our decision concerns the due process limits on the exercise of specific jurisdiction by a State, we leave open the question whether the Fifth Amendment imposes the same restrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a federal court. . . . </p>

<p id="c07e6728-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three years ago, the Court imposed substantial curbs on the exercise of general jurisdiction in its decision in <i>Daimler AG v. Bauman</i>. Today, the Court takes its first step toward a similar contraction of specific jurisdiction by holding that a corporation that engages in a nationwide course of conduct cannot be held accountable in a state court by a group of injured people unless all of those people were injured in the forum State.</p>
<p id="c07e6729-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I fear the consequences of the Court’s decision today will be substantial. The majority’s rule will make it difficult to aggregate the claims of plaintiffs across the country whose claims may be worth little alone. It will make it impossible to bring a nationwide mass action in state court against defendants who are “at home” in different States. And it will result in piecemeal litigation and the bifurcation of claims. None of this is necessary. A core concern in this Court’s personal jurisdiction cases is <span title="144" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-144">p. 144</span>fairness.

<p id="c07e672b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he California courts appropriately exercised specific jurisdiction over respondents’ claims.</p>
<p id="c07e672c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, there is no dispute that Bristol-Myers “purposefully avail[ed] itself” of California and its substantial pharmaceutical market. Bristol-Myers employs over 400 people in California and maintains half a dozen facilities in the State engaged in research, development, and policymaking. It contracts with a California-based distributor, McKesson, whose sales account for a significant portion of its revenue. And it markets and sells its drugs, including Plavix, in California, resulting in total Plavix sales in that State of nearly $1 billion during the period relevant to this suit.</p>
<p id="c07e672d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, respondents’ claims “relate to” Bristol-Myers’ in-state conduct. A claim “relates to” a defendant’s forum conduct if it has a “connect[ion] with” that conduct. So respondents could not, for instance, hale Bristol-Myers into court in California for negligently maintaining the sidewalk outside its New York headquarters—a claim that has no connection to acts Bristol-Myers took in California. But respondents’ claims against Bristol-Myers look nothing like such a claim. Respondents’ claims against Bristol-Myers concern conduct materially identical to acts the company took in California: its marketing and distribution of Plavix, which it undertook on a nationwide basis in all 50 States. That respondents were allegedly injured by this nationwide course of conduct in Indiana, Oklahoma, and Texas, and not California, does not mean that their claims do not “relate to” the advertising and distribution efforts that Bristol-Myers undertook in that State. All of the plaintiffs—residents and nonresidents alike—allege that they were injured by the same essential acts. Our cases require no connection more direct than that.</p>
<p id="c07e672e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, and importantly, there is no serious doubt that the exercise of jurisdiction over the nonresidents’ claims is reasonable. Because Bristol-Myers already faces claims that are identical to the nonresidents’ claims in this suit, it will not be harmed by having to defend against respondents’ claims: Indeed, the alternative approach—litigating those claims in separate suits in as many as 34 different States—would prove far more burdensome. By contrast, the plaintiffs’ “interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief” is obviously furthered by participation in a consolidated proceeding in one State under shared counsel, which allows them to minimize costs, share discovery, and maximize recoveries on claims that may be too small to bring on their own. California, too, has an interest in providing a forum for mass actions like this one: Permitting the non-residents to bring suit in California alongside the residents facilitates the efficient adjudication of the residents’ claims and allows it to regulate more effectively the conduct of both nonresident corporations like Bristol-Myers and resident ones like McKesson . . . . </p>
<p id="c07e672f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nothing in the Due Process Clause prohibits a California court from hearing respondents’ claims—at least not in a case where they are joined to identical claims brought by California residents. . . . </p>

That rule is likely to have consequences far beyond this case.</p>
<p id="c07e8e42-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, and most prominently, the Court’s opinion in this case will make it profoundly difficult for plaintiffs who are injured in different States by a defendant’s nationwide course of conduct to sue that defendant in a single, consolidated action. The holding of today’s opinion is that such an action cannot be brought in a State in which only some plaintiffs were injured. Not to worry, says the majority: The plaintiffs here could have sued Bristol-Myers in New York or Delaware; could “probably” have subdivided their separate claims into 34 lawsuits in the States in which they were injured; and might have been able to bring a single suit in federal court (an “open. . . . question”). Even setting aside the majority’s caveats, what is the purpose of such limitations? What interests are served by preventing the consolidation of claims and limiting the forums in which they can be consolidated? The effect of the Court’s opinion today is to eliminate nationwide mass actions in any State other than those in which a defendant is “’essentially at home.’”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1121B_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1121B_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">4</a></span> See <i>Daimler</i>. Such a rule hands one more tool to corporate defendants determined to prevent the aggregation of individual claims, and forces injured plaintiffs to bear the burden of bringing suit in what will often be far flung jurisdictions. . . . </p>
<p id="c07e8e44-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the Court’s opinion today may make it impossible to bring certain mass actions at all. After this case, it is difficult to imagine where it might be possible to bring a nationwide mass action against two or more defendants headquartered and incorporated in different States. There will be no State where both defendants are “at home,” and so no State in which the suit can proceed. What about a nationwide mass action brought against a defendant not headquartered or incorporated in the United States? Such a defendant is not “at home” in any State. . . . </p>
<p id="c07e8e45-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority chides respondents for conjuring a “parade of horribles,” but says nothing about how suits like those described here will survive its opinion in this case. The answer is simple: They will not.</p>

How serious is this problem? Consider several scenarios—keeping in mind that your responses to some of the scenarios may require some knowledge of the financing of litigation and the organization of the plaintiffs’ bar—topics touched on in Chapter 5.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c07edc76-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the plaintiffs’ standpoint, the easiest cases to bring will be those in which a defective product seriously injures or kills a number of people. Because damages in each case will be substantial, it will usually be possible for such plaintiffs to find competent counsel to represent each plaintiff (or small groups of plaintiffs) individually—in which case it will not matter whether the cases can be consolidated. That leaves, however, the <i>Nicastro</i> situation: a product manufactured outside the United States and not widely distributed—but which inflicts a serious injury.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c07edc77-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And, even if there are substantial individual damages, where can those persons sue? One might assume that they could do so in whatever state they purchased the drug in question. But consider a possibly significant sentence toward the end of the majority opinion: “Alternatively, the plaintiffs who are residents of a particular State—for example, the 92 plaintiffs from Texas and the 71 from Ohio—could <i>probably</i> sue together in their home States.” (Italics added.) “Probably” may merely represent Justice Alito exercising the caution of a good judge in a common law system: Don’t make unnecessary pronouncements about cases not before the court. Or might he mean something else, suggesting that for jurisdiction to lie a defendant must have “purposefully directed” (<i>Nicastro</i>) activity toward the state in question? One feels certain that defendants will probe this question in future cases.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c07edc78-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now consider: What if damages in individual cases were insufficient to warrant individual representation—as may have been the situation in <i>Bristol</i>-<i>Myers</i>?</p>

<li class=""><p id="c07edc79-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the plaintiffs’ standpoint, the ideal would be either a class action (unlikely for reasons you’ll better understand when you encounter that device in Chapter 12) or, putting that aside, “bundling” a number of individual cases together as the lawyers in <i>Bristol-Myers</i> sought to do. How difficult will that be to do? The answer may well depend on how well organized the segment of the plaintiffs’ bar that handles such cases is. For example, the “pharmaceutical bar” on the plaintiffs’ side in the United States is relatively small (comprising scores or perhaps a hundred or so lawyers who regularly handle such cases and who can deploy the considerable resources, intellectual and financial, needed to prosecute them), and the members of this bar have various informal arrangements with each other that facilitate cooperation. One imagines that they would be able to organize aggregate representation of the <i>Bristol-Myers</i> plaintiffs without much difficulty if the stakes warranted it. And there are many such specialized “bars,” with expertise ranging from cruise ship accidents to tire safety and on and on.</p></li>

This is not a topic that the Supreme Court has frequently addressed, but perhaps, given this statement, it will do so soon. Or, is the Court pointing toward Congress?

That criterion was first announced in <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>, in which we stated that due process “mean[s] a course of legal proceedings according to those rules and principles which have been established in our systems of jurisprudence for the protection and enforcement of private rights,” including the “well-established principles of public law respecting the jurisdiction of an independent State over persons and property.” In what has become the classic expression of the criterion, we said in International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945), that a State Court’s assertion of personal jurisdiction satisfies the Due Process Clause if it does not violate “’traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice’” [quoting <i>Milliken v. Meyer</i>]. Since <i>International Shoe</i>, we have only been called upon to decide whether these “traditional notions” permit States to exercise jurisdiction over absent defendants in a manner that deviates from the rules of jurisdiction applied in the 19th century. We have held such deviations permissible, but only with respect to suits arising out of the absent defendant’s contacts with the State. The question we must decide today is whether due process requires a similar connection between the litigation and the defendant’s contacts with the State in cases where the defendant is physically present in the State at the time process is served upon him.</p>

<p id="c07f039d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Among the most firmly established principles of personal jurisdiction in American tradition is that the courts of a State have jurisdiction over nonresidents who are physically present in the State. The view developed early that each State had the power to hale before its courts any individual who could be found within its borders, and that once having acquired jurisdiction over such a person by properly serving him with process, the State could retain jurisdiction to enter judgment against him, no matter how fleeting his visit. See, e.g., Potter v. Allin, 2 Root 63, 67 (Conn. 1793); <span title="150" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-150">p. 150</span>Barrell v. Benjamin, 15 Mass. 354 (1819).

We daresay a contractual exchange swapping those benefits for that power would not survive the “unconscionability” provision of the Uniform Commercial Code. . . . </p>

Regardless of whether Justice Story’s account of the rule’s genesis is mythical, our common understanding now, fortified by a century of judicial practice, is that jurisdiction is often a function of geography. The transient rule is consistent with reasonable expectations and is entitled to a strong presumption that it comports with due process. . . . “If I visit another State,. . . . I knowingly assume some risk that the State will exercise its power over my property or my person while there.

His health and safety are guaranteed by the State’s police, fire, and emergency medical services; he is free to travel on the State’s roads and waterways; he likely enjoys the fruits of the State’s economy as well. Moreover, the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV prevents a state government from discriminating against a transient defendant by denying him the protections of its law or the right of access to its courts. . . . Without transient jurisdiction, an asymmetry would arise: a transient would have the full benefit of the power of the forum State’s courts as a plaintiff while retaining immunity from their authority as a defendant.</p>

Perhaps the answer to this question turns on how broadly one reads <i>Burnham</i>: as a marital property case or a case applicable to all settings.

After all, there are only two possible states that could take jurisdiction (New Jersey, where the husband lives, and California, where the wife lives); isn’t one as reasonable as the other? Moreover, Mr. Burnham, having allegedly reneged on his pre-separation agreement to divide marital property equally with Mrs. Burnham, was not a particularly sympathetic litigant.</p></li>

If she is very sure indeed that the court lacks jurisdiction (and she has no assets in Illinois), she may simply decline to appear, suffer a default judgment, and attack the judgment when Abe seeks to enforce it in a subsequent proceeding. Before Abe can enforce the Illinois judgment in California, he must file it with a California court. Barbara will receive notice of that filing, and with it an opportunity to contest the Illinois court’s jurisdiction over her before the California court issues a writ of execution against Barbara’s assets in California. Even before <i>Pennoyer</i>, that route—known as collateral attack—lay open. D’Arcy v. Ketchum, 52 U.S. 165 (1850). It carries, however, a serious risk, for if the second court rejects the jurisdictional challenge, Barbara can raise no other defenses on the merits.

<li class=""><p id="c07fee37-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the Federal Rules (and state statutes patterned on them), Barbara may raise her jurisdictional defense either in the answer or, if she makes a pre-answer motion, at that time. Read Rule 12(b), (h), and (g). These provisions of Rule 12 make sequencing critical. Making any pre-answer motion that omits a defense of personal jurisdiction is treated as a waiver of objection to jurisdiction. By the same token, making an appearance or litigating other issues but failing to challenge personal jurisdiction in one of these two ways results in waiver of the jurisdictional defense. If Barbara raises the objection at the proper time, she does not waive it by joining it with other defenses or objections, but she must raise it the first time she raises any issue, either by way of motion, appearance, or answer. Moreover, she must litigate the defense promptly. This happens as a matter of course if she makes a pre-answer motion. If she makes no such motion but challenges jurisdiction in her answer, she must promptly move for dismissal on this ground. Although the Rules do not say so explicitly, courts will not look kindly on a defendant who waits until the end of discovery to see how the wind is blowing on the merits of the case before moving to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c07fee38-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a few state systems (and in many older cases), Barbara would raise the jurisdictional claim by making a “special appearance.” See, e.g., Tex. R. Civ. P. 120a (Bender 2011). This is what Dennis Burnham did. The procedure is so called for reasons you can now understand: Otherwise, a defendant who “appeared” might be held to have consented to the state’s exercise of power. What was needed was a form of “appearance” that would not be treated as presence or consent. A “special” appearance permitted the defendant to object to jurisdiction without the action of objecting being itself the basis for jurisdiction.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c07fee39-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, what happens if the defendant has availed herself of the system’s opportunity to challenge jurisdiction but loses? May she immediately appeal that decision? Some states do permit such an immediate appeal; indeed sometimes they require an immediate appeal of the jurisdictional ruling—treating the choice to litigate on the merits as waiving the jurisdictional defense. Other states and the federal system treat a jurisdictional defense like other pretrial rulings and require that an appeal await final judgment. If you were a defendant with a jurisdictional defense, which pattern would you prefer? If you were a plaintiff, which would you prefer?</p></li>

<p id="c0801555-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you have seen, Rule 12(b) allows a defense of lack of personal jurisdiction to be raised either by pre-answer motion or as part of the answer (if, but only if, there has been no pre-answer motion). Why would a defendant choose a pre-answer motion rather than simply bundling everything into her answer to the complaint?</p>
<p id="c0801556-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One straightforward answer is that with a 12(b) motion, the defendant stands to get the case against him dismissed. But there are some other, less obvious reasons a defendant might prefer moving instead of answering in some cases. To get an idea of one possible reason, read Rules 8(b) and 11, which put the lawyer’s professional standing—and also her pocketbook—behind the allegations of an answer: Rule 8(b) requires that an answer respond to each allegation in a complaint—either admitting or denying it; Rule 11 requires that each such admission <span title="158" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-158">p. 158</span>or denial be adequately grounded in law and fact—with court-ordered sanctions possible for violations. Accordingly, an attorney answering a complaint on behalf of a defendant must take the time (and, sometimes, money) to ensure that her answers to each paragraph in the complaint comport with Rule 11. For a short, straightforward complaint, answering will likely take less time than moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction (particularly if briefing the jurisdictional issue requires investigation and discovery, as it did in <i>Hawkins,</i> in Chapter 1). But in a case with complex facts and a straightforward jurisdictional defense, it might be more efficient to move to dismiss than to answer.</p>
<p id="c0801557-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 13 supplies another reason: It requires that an answer contain any counterclaim arising out of the same transaction as the claim. In some cases it might require substantial factual and legal research to decide if a viable counterclaim exists.</p>
<p id="c0801558-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not only money and professional requirements but also time is at stake. Rule 12(b) gives the defendant just 21 days to answer (unless time is extended or the defendant waives service of process). That may be a short time if the lawyer has to do substantial factual investigation to decide on the strategy of the answer. Rule 12(a)(4) extends the time to answer until 14 days after the court has ruled on a pre-answer motion; accordingly a Rule 12 motion buys the defendant additional weeks or months before any answer is required (if it is required at all—the defendant, of course, need not answer a complaint once it has been dismissed!). But be wary about treating a Rule 12 motion as a “free” time extension: The lawyer’s required signature on such a motion constitutes a certificate that “it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to. . . . cause unnecessary delay.” Rule 11(b)(1).</p>

<p id="c080155b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recall <i>Pennoyer</i>’s indication that either power or consent could establish jurisdiction. That proposition remains true today: A defendant may, either at the outset of the lawsuit itself or before it, consent to jurisdiction in a forum. As we have just noted, the Rules reflect this principle: A party with a potential defense based on personal jurisdiction waives that defense by failing to assert it at an early stage of litigation—either in a pre-answer motion or in the answer.</p>
<p id="c080155c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the broader significance of consent as a basis for jurisdiction long remained buried. Before <i>International Shoe</i> the cases that spoke of “consent” often referred to consent implied from presence, or from what modern jurisdictional analysis would refer to as contacts. Such contacts can provide a perfectly adequate basis for jurisdiction, but they are not consent in any strong sense of the word. Since <i>International Shoe</i> recharacterized those implied consent cases as contacts, it has become easier to focus on what one might call “real” consent, a specific agreement to submit to jurisdiction. Cases since <i>International Shoe</i> have greatly expanded parties’ ability to use consent as a jurisdictional tool; as you would expect, this tool finds its most frequent use in cases in which the parties have some prior contractual dealings.</p>
<p id="c080155d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The starting point is National Equipment Rental v. Szukhent, 375 U.S. 311 (1964). The Szukhents, Michigan farmers, leased farm equipment from a New York <span title="159" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-159">p. 159</span>concern. On the back of the lease form was a clause saying that the Szukhents “designate[] Florence Weinberg [at a New York City address] as agent for the purpose of accepting service of process.” When the Szukhents defaulted on the lease, plaintiff sued in New York, serving process on Ms. Weinberg (who notified defendants of the suit), and basing jurisdiction on such service. The Supreme Court upheld this procedure, treating the quoted clause as consent to personal jurisdiction and holding that under the circumstances the clause did not violate due process.</p>
<p id="c080155e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why would National Equipment want such a clause? The most likely reason is that it would reduce costs and increase convenience—National Equipment could use its regular lawyer, who would be a member of the New York bar, and would not have to incur the costs of finding lawyers in whatever states it rented its farm equipment. If required to testify, the company’s officers could do so without disrupting its business. Moreover, National Equipment might have liked that lower costs and greater convenience for it meant increased costs and inconvenience for the Szukhents and others similarly situated. And, in the event a dispute went to trial, it would be before a New York rather than a Michigan jury, which might view the New Yorkers less favorably in a dispute with “one of their own.”</p>
<p id="c080155f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>National Equipment Rental</i>, the parties manipulated jurisdictional rules contractually, the Szukhents consenting to a New York jurisdiction that would not likely have existed without that clause. Notice, however, that the clause in <i>National Equipment Rental</i> permitted service in New York but did not require suit to be brought there; so far as the contract was concerned, the Szukhents could have sued National Equipment Rental in Michigan, and National Equipment could have sued the Szukhents there as well. The next case takes matters further. (A word about substantive background may ease understanding: Federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over admiralty matters, which include the interpretation of contracts calling for carriage of passengers by sea.)</p>

Respondents essentially have conceded that they had notice of the forum-selection provision.

In this context, it would be entirely unreasonable for us to assume that respondents—or any other cruise passenger—would negotiate with petitioner the terms of a forum-selection clause in an ordinary commercial cruise ticket. Common sense dictates that a ticket of this kind will be a form contract the terms of which are not subject to negotiation, and that an individual purchasing the ticket will not have bargaining parity with the cruise line. . . . </p>
<p id="c0803c85-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Including a reasonable forum clause in a form contract of this kind well may be permissible for several reasons: First, a cruise line has a special interest in limiting the fora in which it potentially could be subject to suit. Because a cruise ship typically carries passengers from many locales, it is not unlikely that a mishap on a cruise could subject the cruise line to litigation in several different fora. Additionally, a clause establishing ex ante the forum for dispute resolution has the salutary effect of dispelling any confusion about where suits arising from the contract must be brought and defended, sparing litigants the time and expense of pretrial motions to determine the correct forum and conserving judicial resources that otherwise would be devoted to deciding those motions. Finally, it stands to reason that passengers who purchase tickets containing a forum clause like that at issue in this case benefit in the form of reduced fares reflecting the savings that the cruise line enjoys by limiting the fora in which it may be sued. . . . </p>
<p id="c0806396-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It bears emphasis that forum-selection clauses contained in form passage contracts are subject to judicial scrutiny for fundamental fairness. In this case, there is no indication that petitioner set Florida as the forum in which disputes were to be resolved as a means of discouraging cruise passengers from pursuing legitimate claims. Any suggestion of such a bad-faith motive is belied by two facts: Petitioner has its principal place of business in Florida, and many of its cruises depart from and return to Florida ports. Similarly, there is no evidence that petitioner obtained respondents’ accession to the forum clause by fraud or overreaching. Finally, respondents have conceded that they were given notice of the forum provision and, therefore, presumably retained the option of rejecting the contract with impunity. In the case before us, therefore, we conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in refusing to enforce the forum-selection clause. . . . </p>

<p id="c0806398-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Forum-selection clauses in passenger tickets involve the intersection of two strands of traditional contract law that qualify the general rule that courts will enforce the terms of a contract as written. Pursuant to the first strand, courts traditionally have reviewed with heightened scrutiny the terms of contracts of adhesion, form contracts offered on a take-or-leave basis by a party with stronger bargaining power to a party with weaker power. Some commentators have questioned whether contracts of adhesion can justifiably be enforced at all under traditional contract theory because the adhering party generally enters into them without manifesting knowing and voluntary consent to all their terms. . . . </p>
<p id="c0806399-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second doctrinal principle implicated by forum-selection clauses is the traditional rule that “contractual provisions, which seek to limit the place or court in which an action may. . . . be brought, are invalid as contrary to public policy.” Although adherence to this general rule has declined in recent years, particularly <span title="162" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-162">p. 162</span>following our decision in The Bremen v.

<li class=""><p id="c08063a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now consider the forum selection clause. One of the hallmarks of U.S. law is the extent to which the rules of procedure are “default” rules, rules that govern if the parties have not agreed to something else. Forum selection clauses provide an example of the parties’ ability to make agreements that displace ordinary procedural rules. The clause is a contractual provision. As Justice Stevens’s dissent suggests, courts approaching such clauses will always have at least two questions to consider:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c08063a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, as a matter of contract law, is the clause enforceable? (The same question arises in respect to agreements to arbitrate, as you will learn in Chapter 8.)</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c08063a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, apart from the law of contract, is there some overriding reason that such clauses should not be enforced?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0808ab8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because it would have been easy to distinguish <i>The Bremen</i> (as concerning a contract negotiated by commercially sophisticated parties of equal standing), <i>Carnival Cruise Lines</i> stands as strong evidence of the Court’s willingness to enforce forum selection clauses. Notice, however, that the Court reserved the right not to enforce these types of clauses under some circumstances, and that reservation has remained in the background in subsequent cases (compare <i>Atlantic Marine Construction</i> at the end of this chapter)—even when the Court ultimately enforces the clause.</p></li>

</li>
<li class=""><p id="c0808ab9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Forum selection clauses lie in the middle of a spectrum of contractual provisions that affect procedure; all are common parts of many contracts. Lawyers drafting contracts must consider whether any or all of these types of clauses would be helpful to their clients.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0808aba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Choice of law</i> clauses do not purport to say where suit shall be brought but do provide that the substantive law of a particular jurisdiction will govern disputes arising under the contract. The contract in <i>Burger King</i> (supra page 109) contained such a clause, which specified that Florida law would govern the agreement. (The Burger King franchise agreement did not contain a forum selection clause; compare the date of that case to <i>Carnival Cruise Lines</i> and imagine why Burger King’s lawyers may have hesitated to insert a forum selection clause in that contract.)</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0808abb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Consent-to-jurisdiction</i> clauses say that the parties (or one of the parties) consent to suit in a particular place, thus waiving challenges to personal jurisdiction. Such clauses permit, but do not require, that the suit be brought in the consented-to place. The Supreme Court upheld such a clause in <i>National Equipment Rental v. Szukhent</i>, described supra page 158.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0808abc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Forum selection clauses</i>, exemplified in <i>Carnival Cruise Lines</i>, take things one step further, limiting the forum to a single location.</p></li>

<p id="c0808ac2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Pennoyer</i> established an analytic scheme with three branches—power, consent, and notice. This exploration of personal jurisdiction has so far focused on the first two of these branches. Reflecting on the case law examined so far, one could conclude <span title="164" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-164">p. 164</span>that in order to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant a forum state must have <i>either</i> power (flowing from the kind of relationships discussed in the contacts cases) <i>or</i> the defendant’s consent. Consent may come either in the form of a prelitigation agreement (as in <i>Carnival Cruise Lines v. Shute</i>) or by waiver (when defendant appears but fails to challenge jurisdiction).</p>
<p id="c0808ac3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts of <i>Pennoyer</i>, however, suggested another basic objection to the exercise of a state’s power. In <i>Mitchell v. Neff</i>, the lawsuit preceding <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>, the only notice given to the defendant was a small-print advertisement appearing in the pages of a legal newspaper. In the lower court Neff argued that the statute authorizing notice in this form had not been complied with, and the lower court had reversed on this ground. The U.S. Supreme Court split on the question of statutory interpretation and went on to rest its decision on the absence of power. Because the Court equated power with personal service of process, the question of notice remained buried for some decades: Personal service of process on the defendant within the state simultaneously asserted power and gave notice.</p>
<p id="c0808ac4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issues of power and notice began to diverge as states expanded the concept of consent. For example, in Wuchter v. Pizzutti, 276 U.S. 13 (1928), a precursor of <i>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust</i>, infra, the Supreme Court considered a New Jersey nonresident motorist statute. It treated the use of the state’s roads by nonresidents as consent to both jurisdiction in auto accident cases and to the appointment of the Secretary of State as the agent of the defendant for service of process. But the statute did not explicitly direct the Secretary to give notice to the nonresident driver. Even though the defendant had in fact received notice, the Court struck down the statute.</p>
<p id="c0808ac5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cases like <i>Wuchter</i> made it clear that individuals being sued <i>in personam</i> must receive some form of notice. But again recall the distinction, recognized by <i>Pennoyer</i>, between <i>in personam</i> and <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction. As the <i>Pennoyer</i> Court saw things, because it was perfectly permissible for a state to assume that people kept an eye on their property, a state could presume that the seizure of property (a necessary prerequisite to <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction, you will recall) would also accomplish notice. Behind this rather cavalier assumption may have been an understandable concern. If states were to exercise control over land titles, they had to have some method of rendering binding judgments; a rule that permitted landowners to avoid jurisdiction simply by wandering off without leaving an address would be intolerable. The willingness to presume notice from seizure was a rough but effective way of ensuring that this situation did not arise. But it also posed a potentially troubling question—could a state also dispense with notice if the whereabouts of the property owner <i>were</i> known? The next case, a constitutional landmark, addresses that question.</p>

<p id="c080b0e5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This controversy questions the constitutional sufficiency of notice to beneficiaries on judicial settlement of accounts by the trustee of a common trust fund established under the New York Banking Law. . . . </p>

[The Court notes that same statute required the bank, when the trust was established, to send each beneficiary a letter setting forth the procedure for notifying beneficiaries of the accountings.]</p>
<p id="c080b0ea-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon the filing of the petition for the settlement of accounts, appellant [Mullane] was, by order of the court. . . . appointed special guardian and attorney for all persons known or unknown not otherwise appearing who had or might thereafter have any interest in the income of the common trust fund; and appellee Vaughan was appointed to represent those similarly interested in the principal.

<p id="c080d7ff-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Quite different from the question of a state’s power to discharge trustees is that of the opportunity it must give beneficiaries to contest. Many controversies have raged about the cryptic and abstract words of the Due Process Clause but there can be no doubt that at a minimum they require that deprivation of life, liberty or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.</p>
<p id="c080d800-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In two ways, this proceeding does or may deprive beneficiaries of property. It may cut off their rights to have the trustee answer for negligent or illegal impairments of their interests. Also, their interests are presumably subject to diminution in the proceeding by allowance of fees and expenses to one who, in their names but without their knowledge, may conduct a fruitless or uncompensatory contest. Certainly the proceeding is one in which they may be deprived of property rights and hence notice and hearing must measure up to the standards of due process.</p>
<p id="c080d801-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Personal service of written notice within the jurisdiction is the classic form of notice always adequate in any type of proceeding. But the vital interest of the State in bringing any issues as to its fiduciaries to a final settlement can be served only if interests or claims of individuals who are outside of the State can somehow be determined. A construction of the Due Process Clause which would place impossible or impractical obstacles in the way could not be justified.</p>
<p id="c080d802-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Against this interest of the State we must balance the individual interest sought to be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. This is defined by our holding that “[t]he fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard.” This right to be heard has little reality or worth unless one is informed that the matter is pending and can choose for himself whether to appear or default, acquiesce or contest.</p>
<p id="c080d803-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has not committed itself to any formula achieving a balance between these interests in a particular proceeding or determining when constructive notice may be utilized or what test it must meet. Personal service has not in all circumstances been regarded as indispensable to the process due to residents, and it has more often been held unnecessary as to nonresidents. We disturb none of the established rules on these subjects. No decision constitutes a controlling, or even a very illuminating, precedent for the case before us, but a few general principles stand out in the books.</p>
<p id="c080d804-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections. The notice must be of such nature as reasonably to convey the required information, and it must afford a reasonable time for those interested to make their appearance. But if with due regard for the practicalities and peculiarities of the case these conditions are reasonably met, the constitutional requirements are satisfied. . . . </p>
<p id="c080d805-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But when notice is a person’s due, process which is a mere gesture is not due process. The means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it. The reasonableness and hence the <span title="168" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-168">p. 168</span>constitutional validity of any chosen method may be defended on the ground that it is in itself reasonably certain to inform those affected, or, where conditions do not reasonably permit such notice, that the form chosen is not substantially less likely to bring home notice than other of the feasible and customary substitutes.</p>
<p id="c080d806-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It would be idle to pretend that publication alone, as prescribed here, is a reliable means of acquainting interested parties of the fact that their rights are before the courts. It is not an accident that the greater number of cases reaching this Court on the question of adequacy of notice have been concerned with actions founded on process constructively served through local newspapers. Chance alone brings to the attention of even a local resident an advertisement in small type inserted in the back pages of a newspaper, and if he makes his home outside the area of the newspaper’s normal circulation the odds that the information will never reach him are large indeed. The chance of actual notice is further reduced when, as here, the notice required does not even name those whose attention it is supposed to attract, and does not inform acquaintances who might call it to attention. In weighing its sufficiency on the basis of equivalence with actual notice, we are unable to regard this as more than a feint.</p>
<p id="c080d807-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor is publication here reinforced by steps likely to attract the parties’ attention to the proceeding. It is true that publication traditionally has been acceptable as notification supplemental to other action [such as attachment or seizure] which in itself may reasonably be expected to convey a warning. [But, the Court finds, there is no comparable other action providing notice here.]</p>
<p id="c080d808-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court has not hesitated to approve of resort to publication as a customary substitute in another class of cases where it is not reasonably possible or practicable to give more adequate warning. Thus it has been recognized that, in the case of persons missing or unknown, employment of an indirect and even a probably futile means of notification is all that the situation permits and creates no constitutional bar to a final decree foreclosing their rights.</p>
<p id="c080ff19-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those beneficiaries represented by appellant whose interests or whereabouts could not with due diligence be ascertained come clearly within this category. As to them the statutory notice is sufficient. However great the odds that publication will never reach the eyes of such unknown parties, it is not in the typical case much more likely to fail than any of the choices open to legislators endeavoring to prescribe the best notice practicable.</p>
<p id="c080ff1a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor do we consider it unreasonable for the State to dispense with more certain notice to those beneficiaries whose interests are either conjectural or future or, although they could be discovered upon investigation, do not in due course of business come to knowledge of the common trustee. . . . [W]e have no doubt that. . . . impracticable and extended searches are not required in the name of due process. . . . These are practical matters in which we should be reluctant to disturb the judgment of the state authorities.</p>
<p id="c080ff1b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly we overrule appellant’s constitutional objections to published notice insofar as they are urged on behalf of any beneficiaries whose interests or addresses are unknown to the trustee.</p>

Exceptions in the name of necessity do not sweep away the rule that within the limits of practicability notice must be such as is reasonably calculated to reach interested parties. Where the names and post-office addresses of those affected by a proceeding are at hand, the reasons disappear for resort to means less likely than the mails to apprise them of its pendency.</p>
<p id="c080ff1d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trustee has on its books the names and addresses of the income beneficiaries represented by appellant, and we find no tenable ground for dispensing with a serious effort to inform them personally of the accounting, at least by ordinary mail to the record addresses. Certainly sending them a copy of the statute months and perhaps years in advance does not answer this purpose. The trustee periodically remits their income to them, and we think that they might reasonably expect that with or apart from their remittances word might come to them personally that steps were being taken affecting their interests.</p>
<p id="c080ff1e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We need not weigh contentions that a requirement of personal service of citation on even the large number of known resident or nonresident beneficiaries would, by reasons of delay if not of expense, seriously interfere with the proper administration of the fund. . . . However, no such service is required under the circumstances. This type of trust presupposes a large number of small interests. The individual interest does not stand alone but is identical with that of a class. The rights of each in the integrity of the fund and the fidelity of the trustee are shared by many other beneficiaries. Therefore notice reasonably certain to reach most of those interested in objecting is likely to safeguard the interests of all, since any objection sustained would inure to the benefit of all. We think that under such circumstances reasonable risks that notice might not actually reach every beneficiary are justifiable. . . . The statutory notice to known beneficiaries is inadequate, not because in fact it fails to reach everyone, but because under the circumstances it is not reasonably calculated to reach those who could easily be informed by other means at hand. However it may have been in former times, the mails today are recognized as an efficient and inexpensive means of communication. Moreover, the fact that the trust company has been able to give mailed notice to known beneficiaries at the time the common trust fund was established is persuasive that postal notification at the time of accounting would not seriously burden the plan. . . . </p>
<p id="c080ff1f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Certainly it is instructive, in determining the reasonableness of the impersonal broadcast notification here used, to ask whether it would satisfy a prudent man of business, counting his pennies but finding it in his interest to convey information to many persons whose names and addresses are in his files.

<p id="c080ff20-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that the notice of judicial settlement of accounts required by the New York Banking Law §100-c(12) is incompatible with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment as a basis for adjudication depriving known persons whose whereabouts are also known of substantial property rights.

After the decision, what steps would have to occur to assure that the proceeding would bind the beneficiaries? For the approach taken by the State of New York, see N.Y. CLS Bank §100-c(6) (Matthew Bender 2011) (requiring mail notice to all beneficiaries whose addresses appear in bank’s records or were known to claim any part of the common trust funds).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c081263a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note that in <i>Mullane</i> those who have to receive adequate notice were not, as in most cases, defendants, but rather prospective <i>plaintiffs</i>: those who might wish to challenge the bank’s stewardship of their trust funds. But the case has had its most significant applications in cases involving notice to defendants.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c081263b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Written in broad terms, <i>Mullane</i> interprets the meaning of due process in civil litigation with a reach extending far beyond its specialized facts. But it is less explicit about its implications than about its holding:</p>

<li class=""><p id="c081263c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Mullane,</i> mass mailings were deemed satisfactory. The Court acknowledged that some letters would not get through to their intended recipients but reasoned that because all intended recipients had the same interests, contacting a certain number of people in the group would serve approximately the same function as contacting them all. How would this principle apply to ordinary litigation, in which only a few parties are involved: Is mail adequate then? The answer matters because mail notice reduces the cost of serving process while also increasing the risk that the mail will not reach its addressee.</p></li>

The issue matters greatly in class actions—where both sides in the debate cite <i>Mullane</i>, one stressing its requirement of individual notice, the other stressing its emphasis on practicality. Rule 23(c)(2) straddles the question, requiring individualized notice for some classes with others receiving only “appropriate” notice.

<li class=""><p id="c0814d50-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsequent cases have made it clear that only very unusual circumstances justify failure to give personal notice to any defendant whose identity and whereabouts are known and who is not seeking to evade service. E.g., Walker v. Hutchinson, 352 U.S. 112 (1956) (property seized for condemnation); Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478 (1985) (settlement of decedent’s estate; published notice to creditors in general insufficient when estate knew of claim of particular creditor); Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U.S. 1 (1991) (prejudgment attachment of real property).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0814d51-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One case in this line, Jones v. Flowers, 547 U.S. 220 (2006), goes further—extending to a situation where the owner’s location was not known. In a tax sale, the state authorities sent two certified mail notices to the last known address of the owner who, however, had moved after a marital separation. After the sale had occurred the owner sued to set it aside, citing his failure to get notice. The Supreme Court agreed, indicating that the state should have taken additional steps, without precisely specifying what they were—except that it rejected the idea that the authorities had the obligation to consult other sources, such as the telephone directory or income tax rolls, which would have revealed the new address. Given the low cost of digital searches under current conditions, one can imagine circumstances in which a court would hold that due process requires such a search in order to notify one whose property is about to be taken.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0814d52-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At least one court has taken the availability of digital technology a step further. A New York wife was seeking a divorce. She could not locate her husband to serve process in a conventional way, but he maintained a Facebook account. The judge granted the wife permission to serve process via a Facebook message—so long as the defendant’s Facebook account acknowledged receipt of the notice. http://time.com/3772614/facebook-divorce-summons-blood-dzraku/.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0814d54-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By “service of process,” courts sometimes refer to the way in which the defendant is given notice of the action—the question with which <i>Mullane</i> deals. At other times they use the same phrase to refer instead to the extent of a court’s adjudicatory power—minimum contacts and the like. This blending occurs because, so long as transient jurisdiction is valid, service of process within a state’s borders may confer jurisdiction as well as giving notice (as in <i>Burnham v. Superior Court</i>, supra page 148). Courts and statutes thus speak of “service of process” when they mean jurisdiction or a combination of jurisdiction and service. (The Federal Interpleader Act, 28 U.S.C. §2361, for example, speaks of nationwide “process,” but has been uniformly interpreted to mean nationwide personal jurisdiction.)</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0814d55-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Conversely, courts that conclude that a defendant did not receive constitutionally adequate notice (as in <i>Mullane</i>) will sometimes express that conclusion by saying that the court lacked “jurisdiction”; that is, it lacked one of the constitutional requisites for exercising adjudicatory power—proper notice.</p></li>

<p id="c0819b86-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming that some constitutionally adequate notice is required, one must then decide what exact form notice must take. That form is widely regulated by statute. Rule 4 provides that regulation in federal courts. The current Rule 4 consolidates <span title="173" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-173">p. 173</span>a gradual informalizing of the practice of service of process that has taken place over the last few decades, an evolution enabled in part by <i>Mullane</i>’s suggestion that forms of notice other than personal service would satisfy due process. In pursuit of informality, Rule 4 makes service by an officer of the court (a U.S. marshal) exceptional rather than ordinary. In its place, the Rule provides for service by any person who is not a party and is at least 18 years old. More fundamentally, Rule 4 proposes to replace even this personal but “unofficial” service with a still less formal procedure called “waiver of service” (see Rule 4(d)). Waiver of service uses first-class mail to send a copy of the complaint to the defendant, together with a request that the defendant return a form (found after Rule 4) by mail, waiving formal service of a summons. If the defendant returns that form, the case proceeds as if process had been served. If the defendant does not return the form within the time specified in the Rule, the plaintiff must then proceed to have a summons served more formally, using the procedures set forth in Rule 4(e)-(j). The defendant who waives service does not thereby waive objections to venue or jurisdiction, or any defenses to the merits of the lawsuit. By waiving service the defendant does, however, waive any objections to the sufficiency of the summons or the method by which it was served (Rule 12(b)(4) and (5)).</p>

<ul class="">
<li><p id="c0819b89-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 4 avoided a long-simmering debate about whether ordinary mail is good enough for personal service of process. It uses ordinary mail, all right, but not to <i>serve</i> process; instead it requests a “waiver” that makes formal service unnecessary—even though the request for waiver accomplishes exactly the same notice function as service.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p id="c081c29a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why should the defendant want to make things easy for the plaintiff by waiving formal service of process? Rule 4 provides two answers to that question—a stick for failing to waive and a carrot for doing so. Rule 4(d)(1) imposes on defendants the “duty to avoid unnecessary expenses of serving the summons.” The “stick” enforcing that duty is Rule 4(d)(2) requiring a “defendant located within the United States” to pay the costs of subsequent service if he has without good cause refused to waive service of process. The carrot appears in Rule 12(a)(1)(A)(ii), which extends the time to answer the complaint—from 21 to 60 days for domestic defendants and from 21 to 90 days for foreign defendants. The accompanying notes reflect a hope that this combination of procedural sticks and carrots will make waiver the predominant form of service in federal litigation. If the defendant fails to waive service, Rule 4 goes on to specify various means by which a plaintiff may serve defendants. Plaintiff must also use these means to serve defendants from whom a waiver of service cannot be demanded. Such defendants include the U.S. government, minors <span title="174" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-174">p. 174</span>and incompetents, and others whose service is thought to require special formality so as to reduce the possibility of inadvertent default. Anecdotal accounts suggest that neither the carrot nor the stick has been large enough to make waiver the dominant form of notice.</p>
<p id="c081c29b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where formal service is required, its form depends on the nature of the defendant—individuals and corporations, domestic and foreign defendants, and federal and state government entities all have sections. The Rule specifies the means of serving foreign defendants, a source of special problems and growing concern as the volume of international business increases. Rule 4(f) and (h) set forth a list of ways in which such foreign defendants may be served, incorporating the provisions of the Hague Service Convention of 1969, an important international treaty.</p>

How will a court likely rule?</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class=""><p id="c081c2a0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Service of process gives a defendant notice and thus overcomes what would otherwise be a constitutional obstacle to a valid judgment. Service may also avoid a defense based on the statute of limitations; in many states the statute is satisfied not by filing the suit but only by serving defendant with process. For claims based on federal law, Rule 3 provides that the statute of limitations stops running when the complaint is filed with the court; but defendant must still be notified. The Supreme Court has twice made clear that in diversity actions to which such state statutes apply, actual service (or waiver) is required to satisfy the statute of limitations—in spite of whatever Rule 3 says.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c081c2a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 4 makes one proposition explicit that has been implicit since <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i> and another that the Rules have long skirted: the relation between personal jurisdiction and service of process, and the relation between the reach of personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c081c2a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the first issue, Rule 4(k)(1) states that service (or waiver) establishes jurisdiction over defendants subject to personal jurisdiction. That formula is as important for what it does not say as for what it does. It does <i>not</i> say that service establishes jurisdiction. That had been the assumption of <i>Pennoyer</i>, at least for defendants served in the forum state. Instead, the Rule states that <i>if</i> the requisites of personal jurisdiction exist, proper service establishes jurisdiction. Thus a defendant who waives process, or who has been properly served, remains free to challenge the existence of personal jurisdiction.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c081c2a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="175" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-175">p. 175</span>On the second issue—the personal jurisdiction of federal courts—Rule 4 establishes a four-tier scheme. First, it says that federal courts, at a minimum, have personal jurisdiction over any defendant over whom the state court of the forum state would have such jurisdiction (Rule 4(k)(1)(A)). To that extent—and this provision covers the vast majority of all cases—the personal jurisdiction of state and federal courts “match.” Thus a federal court sitting in California or Georgia has the same jurisdictional reach as a state court in that state—no less, but also no more.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c081c2a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The three remaining provisions deal with situations in which the Rule defines a longer jurisdictional reach for the federal courts than the state courts would have. One occurs when a party is joined to litigation under Rule 14 or 19; in these instances, the Rules provide for a “100-mile bulge” in the personal jurisdiction of a federal district court, even if a state court would not have had such jurisdiction (Rule 4(k)(1)(B)). This provision is particularly useful where federal district courts lie close to state lines: the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York (Manhattan and Brooklyn) and the district courts in New Jersey, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and Delaware are examples.</p>
<p id="c081e9b5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another special situation arises when federal legislation specifically provides for broad, national power of a federal court. One example is a federal statute providing for nationwide service of process (for example, see 28 U.S.C. §1335); another is the enforcement of a civil contempt order arising from litigation involving a federal question Rule 4.1(b).</p>
<p id="c081e9b6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Rule purports to define a new form of personal jurisdiction, limited to federal claims against defendants not subject to personal jurisdiction in any state. Such defendants will inevitably be foreign persons or entities that have insufficient contacts with any single state to create personal jurisdiction. In that situation, Rule 4(k)(2) provides:</p>

<p id="c081e9b7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For a claim that arises under federal law, serving a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant if:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p id="c081e9ba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This provision rests on the proposition that the Due Process Clause permits aggregation of the defendant’s contacts with the United States as a whole for jurisdictional purposes—a question raised in several cases but not definitively resolved. As a quick review of this chapter so far, explain why Rule 4(k)(2) would not have helped the plaintiff in <i>J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro</i>, supra page 111.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c081e9bb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming one knows the proper mode of service, questions still arise over whether the attempted service conformed to the statutory requirements. For example, has the process server left process “with someone of suitable age and discretion” as required by Rule 4(e)(2)(B)? Or what if the process server submits an affidavit that the defendant was served, but defendant denies it? Such questions will often require a hearing and judicial resolution. They may arise, for example, in a motion made under Rule 60(b) to set aside a default judgment <span title="176" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-176">p. 176</span>(as in <i>Peralta</i>, at page 525). They may also arise in those states in which the statute of limitations does not stop running until process is served. And, service may be quashed on defendant’s motion at the preliminary stages of the case for improprieties of form even though the service has performed its chief function—that of notifying the defendant of the commencement of the case.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c081e9bc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Failure to deliver service may benefit the process server if his failures are not caught, because he can collect the fees and not do the work. Such intentional failure to serve process, accompanied by a false affidavit of service, is called “sewer service” by reference to the place where process eventually finds itself. Such abuses may also benefit the plaintiff, who may be able to collect a default judgment based on the sewer service because the defendant was intimidated by the judgment collection process, was ignorant of his rights, or could not afford a lawyer.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c081e9bd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other side of the coin, defendants may sometimes take unfair advantage of service-of-process rules. Wily prospective defendants have sometimes dodged process for long periods, thereby requiring process servers to display ingenuity and sometimes even physical bravery. What should be done with such defendants, who refuse to waive service and then evade the process server? Rule 4(d), which imposes the duty to minimize costs of service on defendants and shifts those costs to a defendant who makes expensive personal service necessary, is one response; Rule 4(m), extending the time for service “if the plaintiff shows good cause,” is another. But such a defendant must be served as a prerequisite even for collecting those costs of service, not to speak of the relief sought on the merits of the lawsuit.</p></li>

The Hague Convention would, for example, guide a Japanese firm seeking to serve a U.S. defendant in a suit brought in Japanese courts; it would also guide a U.S. plaintiff seeking to sue a Spanish defendant in Spain. The Convention provides that each signatory nation must designate a “Central Authority”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11A67_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N11A67_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*3</a></span> responsible for serving process on its nationals.

<p id="c08210d5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our discussion of jurisdiction has thus far proceeded as if the only relevant questions are constitutional power and notice. Each case has silently assumed that the state or federal court in question was authorized to assert jurisdiction if doing so was constitutionally permissible. The issue has been whether the Constitution permitted such an assertion of jurisdiction. We now go behind that assumption in three settings: long-arm statutes, venue laws, and the doctrine of forum non conveniens. Each represents a situation in which the legislature or courts have framed rules that restrict where a lawsuit may take place—even when the Constitution would pose no obstacles.</p>

<p id="c08210d8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court may exercise jurisdiction over a defendant only when the state or federal government authorizes it to do so (and the authorization must be constitutional as applied to the case in question). In the world of <i>Pennoyer</i> such authorization was usually a simple matter: Had the state provided for service of process on a defendant in this situation? As the doctrines of personal jurisdiction expanded (especially in the years after <i>International Shoe</i>), many states began to authorize service (sometimes by mail) on defendants beyond their borders. Because <i>Pennoyer</i> had conceived of such extensions of state court jurisdiction as near-physical exertions of state power, statutes authorizing courts to reach beyond their own borders came to be known as “long-arm” statutes: States were extending their jurisdictional “arms.” The name has stuck.</p>
<p id="c08210d9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some states have enacted long-arm statutes that reach for as much jurisdiction as the Constitution allows. California provides a well-known example:</p>

Ms. Gibbons was giving directions to Mr. Brown, who was driving. The car turned the wrong way onto a one-way street, resulting in a head-on collision that injured both passengers. In 1995, Ms. Gibbons, a Texas resident, sued Mr. Brown in Florida alleging his negligent driving caused the accident; Mrs. Brown was not a party. Two years later, Mrs. Brown, seeking to recover for her own injuries, brought this Florida action against Ms. Gibbons alleging that her faulty directions caused the crash.]</p>

<p id="c08237f4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Obtaining in personam jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant requires a two-pronged showing. First, the plaintiff must allege sufficient jurisdictional facts to bring the defendant within the coverage of the long-arm statute, section 48.193, Florida Statutes. If that prong is satisfied, then the second inquiry is whether sufficient “minimum contacts” are shown to comply with the requirements of due process. <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>. Generally speaking, Florida’s long-arm statutes are of a class that requires more activities or contacts to allow service of process than are currently required by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court.</p>
<p id="c08237f5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to the first part of the inquiry, Mrs. Brown contends that the allegations in her complaint satisfy section 48.193(2), Florida Statutes (1995), which states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c08237f6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A defendant who is engaged in substantial and not isolated activity within this state, whether such activity is wholly intrastate, interstate, or otherwise, is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state, whether or not the claim arises from that activity.</p>
</div>
<p id="c08237f7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties agree that as a general rule in Florida, a plaintiff, by bringing an action, subjects herself to the jurisdiction of the court and to subsequent lawful orders entered regarding the same subject matter of that action. Mrs. Brown broadly construes this general rule to mean that by initiating the 1995 action, Ms. Gibbons subjected herself to Florida jurisdiction with respect to any “lawful orders” that were entered subsequently regarding “the subject matter of the action.” On the other hand, Ms. Gibbons notes that her prior suit was brought in 1995, whereas Mrs. Brown did <span title="179" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-179">p. 179</span>not file her complaint until October 20, 1997. Although Ms. Gibbons acknowledges that her prior action arose from the same vehicular accident as Mrs. Brown’s instant suit, Ms. Gibbons notes that Mrs. Brown was not a party in the earlier action. Furthermore, several years separate the filing of the two proceedings. For purposes of the resolution of the question on appeal, we assume that the 1995 proceedings were over by the time Mrs. Brown brought her 1997 suit.</p>
<p id="c08237f8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Milberg Factors, Inc. v. Greenbaum, 585 So. 2d 1089 (Fla. 3d DCA 1991),. . . . [o]bserving that an entity cannot control where its account debtors choose to relocate, the court stated that “the filing of lawsuits unrelated to this action against account debtors in Florida does not subject Milberg to the jurisdiction of our courts.” Even if we assume (without deciding) that bringing an action in a Florida court can constitute a “substantial and not isolated activity” in some instances, we nevertheless note that Mrs. Brown has not shown that Ms. Gibbons “is engaged” in any activity in this state whatsoever other than defending the present suit. A current defendant’s prior decision to bring a suit in Florida should not act indefinitely as a sword of Damocles hanging perilously over the head of that defendant if she later challenges jurisdiction in a separate suit (albeit a suit arising from the same subject matter). . . . Given the length of time between the two actions and the fact that the prior suit named as the defendant a non-party in the instant proceedings, we conclude that Mrs. Brown has not alleged a satisfactory ground for personal jurisdiction pursuant to statutory subsection (2). The appellee does not suggest, nor do we find, that the appellant’s filing the 1995 action in the Florida court would, by itself, satisfy any of the alternative grounds for jurisdiction set forth in section 48.193(1)(a)-(1)(h). . . . </p>

When Adam sued in Texas to enforce his judgment, Saenger defended on the ground that the California court lacked personal jurisdiction. So far as the record showed, Saenger’s one and only contact with California was the filing of the lawsuit in question. That was enough, held the U.S. Supreme Court: “The plaintiff having, by his voluntary act in demanding justice from the defendant, submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court, there is nothing arbitrary or unreasonable in treating him as being there for all purposes for which justice to the defendant demands his presence.” Id. at 67-68.

See, for example, 28 U.S.C. §1391(b), which puts venue “where any defendant resides” if all defendants reside in the same state or where “a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred.” Because of this, the inquiries necessary under the venue statutes duplicate those involved in personal jurisdiction questions, but focus on contacts with a judicial district within a state, not with the state as a whole.</p>
<p id="c0828637-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why, then, have both a law of personal jurisdiction and one of venue? At a technical level the answer to that question is easy: Unlike personal jurisdiction, venue locates litigation not just in a state but in a particular federal judicial district within that state. For example, suppose a defendant is clearly subject to personal jurisdiction in Florida, which has three federal judicial districts. See 28 U.S.C. §133(a). Principles of personal jurisdiction tell plaintiff that she can sue in Florida, but the venue statutes and cases interpreting them will tell her in which of the three districts venue will lie, and thus whether she needs to file the complaint at a courthouse in Tallahassee, Tampa, or Miami.</p>
<p id="c0828638-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal venue statute took its present form in 2011, following a century-long evolution during which it was occasionally impossible to find a judicial district in which venue lay even when there was both personal and subject matter jurisdiction over the case and parties.</p>
<p id="c0828639-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute’s structure is straightforward. Subsection (a) makes it clear that §1391 provides the venue provisions for all civil actions in federal courts—unless a specific statute provides otherwise. (For an example of a special venue provision, see 28 U.S.C. §1397, which provides that in an interpleader action—covered in Chapter 12—venue lies in any district where any claimant resides.)</p>
<p id="c082863a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsection (b) then provides three potential alternative venues. The first two are primary and the third (in (b)(3)) comes into play only if the first two do not yield an appropriate venue.</p>
<p id="c082863b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsections (c) and (d) clarify an issue that had proved vexing under previous versions of the statute: Given that “residency” often establishes venue, how does one define that term?</p>
<p id="c082863c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For this analysis, entities are treated differently than natural persons. The statute has separate definitions for persons and for entities (corporations, limited liability companies, and the like). Though the statute does not say so, for venue purposes the principal place of business of an entity will likely be defined the same way under the venue statute as it is for diversity jurisdiction—as the “nerve center” of the entity. <i>Hertz Corp. v. Friend</i>, infra page 225. If a state has more than one district? See §1391(d).</p>
<p id="c082863d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute also addresses the issue of residency for citizens of other countries. The statute makes clear that non-citizens who have been admitted by the United States as permanent residents are to be treated as citizens for venue purposes under subsection (c)(1). Courts are split about whether <i>all</i> non-citizens, regardless of whether they are lawful permanent residents, reside in the judicial district in which they are domiciled for venue purposes under subsection (c)(1). For a case concluding they do, see Alvardo v. United States, 2017 WL 2303758 (D.N.J. May 25, 2017).</p>

<p id="c082d474-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to the complaint. . . . on March 14, 2011, the plaintiff purchased from Greyhound in Pensacola a one-way ticket to Tunica, Mississippi, to arrive at 5:05 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m</span>. on March 15. A Greyhound bus delivered the plaintiff from Pensacola to Mobile just after midnight on March 15. Seven hours later, Greyhound personnel directed the plaintiff to board a Colonial Trailways bus. The driver, defendant Terry Reeves, announced that the bus was traveling only to Jackson, Mississippi and would thereafter return to Mobile. Reeves also announced that his bus was scheduled to arrive in Jackson at 12:05 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m</span>. and that a bus would depart Jackson at 12:30 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m</span>., arriving in Tunica at 5:05 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m</span>. The plaintiff, upon hearing this, decided it was time for a nap.</p>
<p id="c082d475-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So far, so good. But when the plaintiff awakened, he realized it was almost 2:30 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m</span>. and that the bus was now headed back to Mobile. He and Reeves exchanged words, but the bus continued to Mobile, where the plaintiff remained for over nine hours before his brother sent him a pre-paid ticket back to Pensacola. Because of these events, the plaintiff “missed his court-date and was found guilty in absentia.” The plaintiff sues Greyhound, Colonial Trailways and Reeves on several state law causes of action. Subject matter jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship.</p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c082d476-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">Discussion</p></div>
<p id="c082d477-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Greyhound argues that the action should be dismissed for improper venue or, in the alternative, for failure to state a claim. It is well established that a court should address challenges to subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) and challenges to personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2) before considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion based on failure to state a claim. . . . For similar reasons, the Court concludes that it should resolve Greyhound’s challenge to venue under Rule 12(b)(3) before addressing its Rule 12(b)(6) motion. See Arrowsmith v. United Press International, 320 F.2d 219, 221 (2d Cir. 1963) (venue should be resolved before addressing failure to state a claim).</p>
<p id="c082fb88-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although unnoted by the parties, “[t]he plaintiff has the burden of showing that venue in the forum is proper.”. . . . However, “[w]hen a complaint is dismissed on the basis of improper venue without an evidentiary hearing, ’the plaintiff must present only a prima facie showing of venue.’”. . . . “Further, ’[t]he facts as alleged in the complaint are taken as true to the extent they are uncontroverted by defendants’ affidavits.’”. . . . Greyhound did not request an evidentiary hearing, so the plaintiff need present only a prima facie showing of venue. Neither side presented affidavits or other evidence, so the Court’s review is limited to the complaint. As discussed below, that document does not suffice to meet the plaintiff’s burden of making a prima facie showing of proper venue.</p>
<p id="c082fb89-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="185" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-185">p. 185</span>The propriety of venue in this case is to be measured by 28 U.S.C. §1391(b). This statute provides two means of establishing proper venue, with a third means available if proper venue cannot be established under either of the first two.</p>
<p id="c082fb8a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Venue is proper in “a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located.” 28 U.S.C. §1391(b)(1). For purposes of this provision, an individual resides “in the United States district in which that person is domiciled.” §1391(c)(1). According to the complaint, Reeves “is a citizen of Florida with his domicile residence in the State of Florida.”. . . . Because Reeves does not reside in Alabama, venue is not proper under Section 1391(b)(1).</p>
<p id="c082fb8b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Venue is also proper in “a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred.” 28 U.S.C. §1391(b)(2). Under this provision, “[o]nly the events that directly give rise to a claim are relevant.”. . . . The only event that occurred in this District was that the plaintiff changed buses here, and that event did not “directly give rise to a claim.” The plaintiff does not allege that the transfer constituted a breach of contract, only that Greyhound had not told him, when he purchased the ticket to Tunica the previous day, that he would be transferring to a Colonial Trailways bus. Greyhound’s alleged negligence and breach of contract, according to the complaint, derive from its failure to safely and successfully transport the plaintiff to Tunica, and nothing that occurred in Alabama caused or contributed to such failure. According to the complaint, Greyhound contracted to get him to Tunica at 5:05 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m</span>. on March 15, and taking the Colonial Trailways bus to Jackson would have (but for his sleeping through the transfer) gotten him to Tunica at precisely that time. The mere fact that the plaintiff passed through this District and changed buses here is not a “part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim,” much less a “substantial” part. Accordingly, venue is not proper under Section 1391(b)(2).</p>
<p id="c082fb8c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the plaintiff’s claims certainly occurred in the Southern District of Mississippi. Greyhound explicitly concedes the propriety of venue in that District. . . . Because proper venue can be established under Section 1391(b)(2) (only not in this District), the plaintiff cannot rely on Section 1391(b)(3) to establish venue.</p>
<p id="c082fb8d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.” 28 U.S.C. §1406(a). To the extent the phrase “in which it could have been brought” requires that personal jurisdiction over the defendants exist in the transferee district, specific personal jurisdiction exists in the Southern District of Mississippi, as the plaintiff’s claims arise from and relate to the defendants’ contacts with that District—Reeves’ driving of the plaintiff there (and not waking him up in Jackson), Colonial Trailways’ operation of the bus there, and Greyhound’s sale of a ticket to transport the plaintiff through there. The parties make no argument to the contrary.</p>
<p id="c082fb8e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Greyhound requests the Court to dismiss rather than transfer, but it offers no explanation why this route should be preferred. As this Court has noted, “[g]enerally, the interests of justice [favor] transferring a case to the appropriate judicial district rather than dismissing it.” Boutwell v. Advance Construction Services, Inc., 2007 WL 2988238 at 3 (S.D. Ala. 2007) (internal quotes omitted).

<p id="c08322ae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When an action is brought in state court, federal venue statutes are irrelevant; they only apply to actions originally brought in the federal courts. (Cases removed to the federal courts from state courts are similarly not subject to federal venue requirements; venue lies in the district encompassing the state court from which the case is removed.) States, however, have their own venue statutes that indicate in which county an action must be brought. Professors James, Hazard, and Leubsdorf have summarized the state venue rules as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c08322af-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In other actions, state venue rules—in contrast to federal venue rules—follow variegated patterns that employ one or more of the following tests: (a) where the cause of action, or part of it, arose or accrued; (b) where some fact is present or happened; (c) where the defendant resides; (d) where the defendant is doing business; (e) where the defendant has an office or place of business, an agent, or representative, or where an agent or officer of defendant resides; (f) where the plaintiff resides; (g) where the plaintiff is doing business; (h) where the defendant may be found; (i) where the defendant may be summoned or served; (j) in the county designated in the plaintiff’s complaint; (k) in any county; (l) where the seat of government is located. The tests that give plaintiff the widest choice are often applicable only when defendant is a nonresident of the state. The defendant’s residence is the most common provision for venue.</p>

<p id="c08322b1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another principle that is sometimes given the label “venue” is the local-action rule for certain causes of action, chiefly those involving real property. The rule states that only the courts of the state where land is located will hear cases that raise any question concerning title to the land. In the early case of Livingston v. Jefferson, 15 F. Cas. 660 (C.C.D. Va. 1811) (No. 8,411), Livingston sought to sue Thomas Jefferson for trespass to land located in Louisiana. As Jefferson was a resident of Virginia and not subject to jurisdiction elsewhere, and as the court ruled that under English common law the action was local and had to be brought where the land was located, the plaintiff was effectively left without a remedy. The rule has since been changed by statute in many states and was rejected by court decision in Reasor-Hill Corp. v. Harrison, 220 Ark. 521, 249 S.W.2d 994 (1952). Another traditional local action is an action by a state to collect taxes, although increasingly that restriction has been abandoned. E.g., Oklahoma ex rel. Oklahoma Tax Committee v. Neely, 225 Ark. 230, 282 S.W.2d 150 (1955).</p>

<p id="c08322b4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both state and federal courts may decline to exercise jurisdiction even though they possess it. You have already encountered one example of this power: long-arm statutes that do not extend as far as the Constitution would permit. As personal <span title="188" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-188">p. 188</span>jurisdiction has expanded under modern cases, courts have more frequently exercised the power of declining to hear cases. Both statutes and common law decisions express this power to decline jurisdiction. This section examines two of the rationales for declining to exercise jurisdiction. One—the common law doctrine of forum non conveniens<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11D67_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N11D67_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*4</a></span>—affects both state and federal courts. The other—transfer among federal judicial districts under 28 U.S.C. §1404—applies only to the federal courts, allowing them to move cases around the country “for the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interests of justice.”</p>
<p id="c08322b6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both §1404(a) transfer and forum non conveniens dismissals flow from the same perception: that there will be circumstances in which a court has the power to hear a case but, for reasons of justice or efficiency, should not do so. For example, the judge may conclude that although jurisdiction is clear, the preponderance of witnesses, perhaps some of them severely disabled, will have to travel long distances to testify. Under these or similar circumstances, a federal court may decide to either transfer the case to another federal court under §1404(a) or dismiss it under the forum non conveniens doctrine for trial in another country. A state court might take a similar action, transferring (under a state statute analogous to §1404(a)) to another court in the same state or dismissing under the forum non conveniens doctrine for refiling in another state or country. We start with the more basic doctrine, forum non conveniens.</p>

Several days after her appointment, Reyno commenced separate wrongful-death actions against Piper and Hartzell in the Superior Court of California, claiming negligence and strict liability. . . . Reyno candidly admits that the action against Piper and Hartzell was filed in the United States because its laws regarding liability, capacity to sue, and damages are more favorable to her position than are those of Scotland. Scottish law does not recognize strict liability in tort. Moreover, it permits wrongful-death actions only when brought by a decedent’s relatives. The relatives may sue only for “loss of support and society.”</p>

<p id="c08397f8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals erred in holding that plaintiffs may defeat a motion to dismiss on the ground of forum non conveniens merely by showing that the substantive law that would be applied in the alternative forum is less favorable to the plaintiffs than that of the present forum. The possibility of a change in substantive law should ordinarily not be given conclusive or even substantial weight in the forum non conveniens inquiry.</p>

Jurisdiction and venue requirements are often easily satisfied. As a result, many plaintiffs are able to choose from among several forums. Ordinarily, these plaintiffs will select that forum whose choice-of-law rules are most advantageous. Thus, if the possibility of an unfavorable change in substantive law is given substantial weight in the forum non conveniens inquiry, dismissal would rarely be proper. . . . </p>
<p id="c08397fc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upholding the decision of the Court of Appeals would result in other practical problems. At least where the foreign plaintiff named an American manufacturer as defendant, a court could not dismiss the case on grounds of forum non conveniens where dismissal might lead to an unfavorable change in law. The American courts, which are already extremely attractive to foreign plaintiffs, would become even more attractive. The flow of litigation into the United States would increase and further congest already crowded courts.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11DF1_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N11DF1_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">19</a></span>  . . . </p>

Of course, if the remedy provided by the alternative forum is so clearly inadequate or unsatisfactory that it is no remedy at all, the unfavorable change in law may be given substantial weight; the district court may conclude that dismissal would not be in the interests of <span title="191" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-191">p. 191</span>justice. In these cases, however, the remedies that would be provided by the Scottish courts do not fall within this category.

In <i>Koster</i>, the Court indicated that a plaintiff’s choice of forum is entitled to greater deference when the plaintiff has chosen the home forum. When the home forum has been chosen, it is reasonable to assume that this choice is convenient. When the plaintiff is foreign, however, this assumption is much less reasonable.

Particularly with respect to the question of relative ease of access to sources of proof, the private interests point in both directions. As respondent emphasizes, records concerning the design, manufacture, and testing of the propeller and plane are located in the United States. She would have greater access to sources of proof relevant to her strict liability and negligence theories if trial were held here.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11E37_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N11E37_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">25</a></span> However, the District Court did not act unreasonably in concluding that fewer evidentiary problems would be posed if the trial were held in Scotland.

On the basis of its choice-of-law analysis, it concluded that if the case were tried in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania law would apply to Piper and Scottish law to Hartzell. It stated that a trial involving two sets of laws would be confusing to the jury. It also noted its own lack of familiarity with Scottish law. Consideration of these problems was clearly appropriate under <i>Gilbert</i>. . . . </p>
<p id="c083e52c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Scotland has a very strong interest in this litigation. The accident occurred in its airspace. All of the decedents were Scottish. Apart from Piper and Hartzell, all potential plaintiffs and defendants are either Scottish or English. As we stated in <i>Gilbert</i>, there is “a local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.” Respondent argues that American citizens have an interest in ensuring that American manufacturers are deterred from producing defective products, and that additional deterrence might be obtained if Piper and Hartzell were tried in the United States, where they could be sued on the basis of both negligence and strict liability. However, the incremental deterrence that would be gained if this trial were held in American court is likely to be insignificant. The American interest in this accident is simply not sufficient to justify the enormous commitment of judicial time and resources that would inevitably be required if the case were to be tried here.</p>

Plaintiffs were U.S. citizens, survivors and heirs of the victims of shootings in an Egyptian hotel operated by defendant, where a gunman, apparently motivated by political and religious animus, had shot six people. Plaintiffs brought a federal diversity action in New York against the New York-based corporate hotel operator. The district court dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds, finding that an Egyptian court would be more familiar with Egyptian law, which governed the action, that Egypt’s commitment to tourism assured that the suit would be handled properly, and that there was already related litigation pending in Egypt—suits brought by the families of French and Italian victims. The Second Circuit reversed, holding that the district court had abused its discretion in dismissing.

We disagree. Section 1406(a) and Rule 12(b)(3) allow dismissal only when venue is “wrong” or “improper.” Whether venue is “wrong” or “improper” depends exclusively on whether the court in which the case was brought satisfies the requirements of federal venue laws, and those provisions say nothing about a forum-selection clause.</p>

<p id="c084819c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This question—whether venue is “wrong” or “improper"—is generally governed by 28 U.S.C. §1391.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11FC6_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N11FC6_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">2</a></span> That provision states that “[e]xcept as otherwise provided by <i>law</i>. . . . this section <i>shall</i> govern the venue of <i>all civil actions</i> brought in district courts of the United States.” §1391(a)(1) (emphasis added). . . . Whether the parties entered into a contract containing a forum-selection clause has no bearing on whether a case falls into one of the categories of cases listed in §1391(b). As a result, a case filed in a district that falls within §1391 may not be dismissed under §1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3).</p>

That language cannot reasonably be read to allow judicial consideration of other, extrastatutory limitations on the forum in which a case may be brought.</p>
<p id="c084819f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The structure of the federal venue provisions confirms that they alone define whether venue exists in a given forum.

<p id="c08481a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although a forum-selection clause does not render venue in a court “wrong” or “improper” within the meaning of §1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3), the clause may be enforced through a motion to transfer under §1404(a). That provision states that “[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.” Unlike §1406(a), §1404(a) does not condition transfer on the initial forum’s being “wrong.” And it permits transfer to any district where venue is also proper (i.e., “where [the case] might have been brought”) or to any other district to which the parties have agreed by contract or stipulation.</p>
<p id="c08481a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 1404(a) therefore provides a mechanism for enforcement of forum-selection clauses that point to a particular federal district. And for the reasons we address in Part III, a proper application of §1404(a) requires that a forum-selection clause be “given controlling weight in all but the most exceptional cases<i>.</i>” <i>Stewart</i>. . . . (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>
<p id="c08481a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Atlantic Marine argues that §1404(a) is not a suitable mechanism to enforce forum-selection clauses because that provision cannot provide for transfer when a forum-selection clause specifies a state or foreign tribunal,. . . . and we agree with Atlantic Marine that the Court of Appeals failed to provide a sound answer to this problem. The Court of Appeals opined that a forum-selection clause pointing to a nonfederal forum should be enforced through Rule 12(b)(3), which permits a party to move for dismissal of a case based on “improper venue.” As Atlantic Marine persuasively argues, however, that conclusion cannot be reconciled with our construction of the term “improper venue” in §1406 to refer only to a forum that does not satisfy federal venue laws. If venue is proper under federal venue rules, it does not matter for the purpose of Rule 12(b)(3) whether the forum-selection clause points to a federal or a nonfederal forum.</p>
<p id="c08481a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Instead, the appropriate way to enforce a forum-selection clause pointing to a state or foreign forum is through the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i>. Section 1404(a) is merely a codification of the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i> for the subset of cases in which the transferee forum is within the federal court system; in such cases, Congress has replaced the traditional remedy of outright dismissal with transfer. . . . For the <span title="198" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-198">p. 198</span>remaining set of cases calling for a nonfederal forum, §1404(a) has no application, but the residual doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i> “has continuing application in federal courts.” Sinochem [Intl. Co. v. Malaysia Intl. Shipping, 549 U.S. at 430 (2007)] (noting that federal courts invoke <i>forum non conveniens</i> “in cases where the alternative forum is abroad, and perhaps in rare instances where a state or territorial court serves litigational convenience best”). . . . And because both §1404(a) and the <i>forum non conveniens</i> doctrine from which it derives entail the same balancing-of-interests standard, courts should evaluate a forum-selection clause pointing to a nonfederal forum in the same way that they evaluate a forum-selection clause pointing to a federal forum. . . . </p>

<p id="c084cfda-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This chapter has explored the elaborate law developed to answer a single question: In which court(s) can this lawsuit against this defendant be brought? The complexity of the doctrine answering that question testifies both to its practical importance and to a constitutional structure that recognizes a degree of independent autonomy and sovereignty in the several states. Simply put: It matters whether Alabama or California courts will hear a case because constitutional structure gives the governments of Alabama and California, including their respective courts, the last word on many important questions. Under our federal structure, however, there is an overarching—but limited—federal sovereignty with its own court system. So, in each case, the question is not simply whether the case belongs in State <i>A</i> or State <i>B</i>, but whether the case can be heard in a federal court instead of a state court. The next chapter explores the answer to that question.</p>

C is correct because, in the absence of any contacts with California, jurisdiction would not lie against an out-of-state defendant. A is wrong because of Rule 12(b)(2). D is wrong because, unlike federal subject matter jurisdiction, which can be raised on the court’s own motion, personal jurisdiction is waived unless raised by the defendant.</p>
<p id="c0856c4a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q2.</b> A, B, and C are correct responses. A is correct because, unlike <i>Atlantic Marine Construction</i>, no district in California has venue according to 28 U.S.C. §1391 and venue is therefore improper. B is correct because, again in contrast to <i>Atlantic Marine Construction,</i> venue is improper in any district in California, and <i>Thompson v. Greyhound Lines</i> teaches us that, when venue does not lie, one of the options is to move under §1406 for transfer to a district where venue is proper. C is correct because <i>Atlantic Marine Construction</i> leaves this issue open: If venue is <i>improper,</i> does a motion to transfer under a forum selection clause lie—or is that motion appropriate only when, disregarding the forum selection clause, venue would be proper? D is wrong because a 12(b)(6) motion goes to the validity of the complaint, not the appropriate location of the court.</p>
<p id="c0856c4b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q3.</b> C is the only correct response. C is correct because, by failing to raise the question of personal jurisdiction either in a pre-answer motion or in its answer, GrowCo has waived the defense. Rule 12(h)(1). A is wrong because, even if its contentions about contacts are correct, GrowCo has waived. B is doubly wrong: both because personal jurisdiction <i>is</i> often about facts and because defendant has waived the defense.</p>
<p id="c0856c4c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4.</b> B is the only accurate response. The federal courts, and most state systems, allow one to challenge jurisdiction, litigate on the merits, and then to argue on appeal that both the refusal to grant a jurisdictional dismissal as well as other errors on the merits warrant reversal.</p>

A is correct because some of <i>Mullane</i>’s power came from its ruling against a litigant relying on “seizure” plus published notice. B is correct because the opinion is full of this kind of language. C is correct because that was <i>Mullane</i>’s answer to the problem of unnotified beneficiaries: They would be bound because adequately represented by someone with the same interests. D is correct because Justice Jackson had only one year of law school.</p>
<p id="c0856c4e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q6.</b> B and D are the correct responses. A is wrong because Rule 4(d)(1) makes it explicit that waiver of service is not a waiver of jurisdictional objections. C is wrong because failure or refusal to waive creates liability for costs of service, but has no further consequence. B is correct because the extension of time to answer is one of the carrots contained in Rule 4(d)(3). D is correct because 4(d)(2) provides for the imposition of costs “unless good cause [for failure to waive] be shown.”</p>
<p id="c0856c4f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q7.</b> D is the correct response. A is wrong because even the cases that list interactivity as an element in jurisdictional analysis make use of a sliding scale in which the amount of interactivity is relevant. B is wrong because the relevant question will be whether Sam purposefully availed himself of the North Carolina market; while making a product especially suitable for North Carolina would be one way of demonstrating that availment, there are many others—such as shipping his product to a North Carolina buyer—that indicate purposeful availment. C is wrong because, given the substance of the lawsuit, it will be Sam’s product, not Sam’s personal travels that will be relevant. D is correct because the ability to know that one is doing business with a North Carolina customer is highly relevant to the question of purposeful availment.</p>
<p id="c0859360-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q8.</b> C is the correct response. A is wrong because Purchaser can demonstrate specific jurisdiction if the facts warrant it. B is wrong because federal courts need both subject matter jurisdiction (here based on diversity) <i>and</i> personal jurisdiction. C is correct because under the stream-of-commerce cases as well as <i>Hanson v. Denkla</i> the relevant question will be the extent to which Maker sought to avail itself of business opportunities in Washington. D is wrong because both <i>Nicastro</i> and <i>Daimler</i> say that the relevant question is the extent to which Maker tried to sell its cars in Washington, not the precise corporate structure involved; see, e.g., footnote 7 in <i>Daimler.</i></p>
<p id="c0859361-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q9.</b> C is probably the correct response. <i>Bristol-Myers Squibb v. Superior Court</i> held that California lacked jurisdiction over the out-of-state plaintiffs under similar circumstances. A is wrong because, for states in which general jurisdiction does not lie, the cases require a connection between defendant’s actions and this claim against this plaintiff—not just a general effort to do business in the state. B is wrong: <i>Daimler AG v. Bauman</i> held that even a high volume of business was not enough to support jurisdiction over claims unrelated to that business.</p>
