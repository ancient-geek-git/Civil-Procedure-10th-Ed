<p id="c05dc01a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Civil procedure is a course about truth and justice—about how we define those words, how we seek the goals they express, and how we sometimes lose sight of them. It is also, inevitably, a course about greed, venality, and oppression, and the running battle waged against these fundamental human characteristics.</p>
<p id="c05dc01b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mixed with these lofty themes are the minutiae of lawyers’ work. Civil procedure is about lawyers—about their relation to their clients, to their profession, and to the courts. Most of the first year of law school concerns what lawyers call substantive law, the rules governing behavior in ordinary life: property, criminal law, torts, and contract. Everyone needs to know at least a little about these topics simply to function in the everyday world. But procedure is insiders’ law, of special importance to those administering the legal system.</p>
<p id="c05dc01c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those insiders turn to procedure to describe the rules of the elaborate game called litigation. At one level, procedure is the etiquette of ritualized battle, defining the initiation, development, and conclusion of a lawsuit. What does one have to say to get a court to pay attention? Suppose my adversary wants to invoke a court’s help—can I instead take the dispute to a different forum? From whom may a person with a grievance seek relief? What kind of relief? If I believe my adversary has information that would help me to prove my case, may I demand it of her? All these questions—involving what lawyers would call pleading, forum selection, <span title="2" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-2">p. 2</span>joinder, remedies, and discovery—are dealt with in civil procedure. The answers to such questions are important to any lawyer who needs to help a client in a lawsuit. Although one might think that the underlying merits of the case are all that matters at the end of the day, procedural rulings—about where a case can be filed, whether a case can proceed to discovery, and whether a party is entitled to the discovery he seeks—can determine who wins and who loses.</p>
<p id="c05dc01d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But if procedure were only a set of rules about the etiquette of lawsuits, it would be hard to justify its place in the first-year curriculum. Another facet of procedure justifies that place: Procedure mirrors our most basic notions of fairness and the meaning of justice. If coming to a quick decision were all that mattered, we could flip coins to decide lawsuits. We don’t flip coins because solving an important dispute without reference to its merits strikes us as unjust. This bedrock principle of fairness and justice finds expression both in the details of procedural design and in several parts of the U.S. Constitution, most notably the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>
<p id="c05dc01e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Commentators, litigants, and courts do not, however, agree about what procedural mechanisms best reflect these overarching values. Some argue that our system is overly obsessed with permitting the adversarial airing of grievances. Proposed solutions range from streamlining adjudication to nonadjudicative dispute resolution. The system’s defenders argue both that the critics overstate the pathologies of modern civil litigation and that adjudication has proved to be a major force for social justice, economic growth, and political stability over the past two centuries. Such conflicting views lurk in the background at every turn of our path.</p>
<p id="c05de72f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This chapter seeks to give you some feel for procedural issues as they arise in the life cycle of a civil lawsuit. It will raise more questions than it answers, but it will offer you a sense of the course of civil litigation and a taste of the kinds of problems lawyers describe as procedural. Seeing the whole picture all at once will make more meaningful our closer investigation of these issues in the weeks to come.</p>
<p id="c05de730-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We start with a simple and plausible fact situation: Peters, a student at the University of Michigan, spent his winter vacation in Champaign, Illinois, where his parents have recently moved from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. While visiting his parents, Peters was seriously injured in an automobile accident with Dodge, a lifelong resident of Champaign and owner of a popular ice cream parlor in the town. The remainder of this chapter deals with issues that might flow from this everyday occurrence.</p>
</div>
<div id="c05de731-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c05de732-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">2.&nbsp;Clients, Lawyers, Procedure, and Strategy</p></h3></div>

<p id="c05de733-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider first whether and how this accident might enter the formal legal system. Most such episodes will never get near lawyers or courts. If Peters had adequate medical insurance and no lost wages, he might have little reason to sue Dodge. Or Dodge (or his insurer) might well offer Peters a satisfactory settlement before a suit is filed. Or Peters might want to sue but be unable to find a lawyer who would take his case.</p>
<p id="c05e0e44-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These three alternatives describe the fate of most disputes that arise in our society, with the consequence that they will never enter the official judicial system. For the rest of this book—and for the rest of law school—you will be dealing with the exceptional instances, the disputes that do find their way into court.</p>
<p id="c05e0e45-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="3" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-3">p. 3</span>What would need to happen? First, Peters would probably need to find a lawyer. (In the United States individuals can prosecute their cases themselves—<i>in pro</i>. <i>per</i>. or <i>pro se</i>, in the jargon of the law<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1006B_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1006B_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span>—but most consider lawyers worthwhile for litigation, in part because lawyers know their way around the procedural system.) We’ll deal later, in Chapter 5, with how people in Peters’s situation might find a lawyer; this matters a good deal, and because it does, it deserves more attention than it can get in this introduction.</p>
<p id="c05e3557-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But—even in this introduction—it bears emphasizing that the lawyer-client relationship involves <i>two</i> decisions at the outset. First, Peters, the prospective client, must locate a lawyer. For clients like Peters, that can be a bewildering process. Most individuals deal with lawyers quite infrequently, and therefore lack knowledge about what qualities to look for. Rules of professional ethics allow lawyers to advertise, but only in a limited way, and we have yet to develop a robust and reliable way of rating lawyers. So it’s likely that someone in Peters’s position would have to rely on word-of-mouth recommendations: Did a friend or relative have a lawyer she would recommend?</p>
<p id="c05e3558-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose Peters does get such a recommendation and approaches Ursula Sands, a lawyer who practices in Champaign, where the accident occurred and where Peters’s family lives. Further suppose that Sands’s practice includes the kind of case Peters contemplates (as opposed, say, to a practice limited to wills or business transactions). When he visits Sands’s office, the second decision must be made: Does Sands want to represent Peters? Experienced lawyers will tell you that the most important decision they make in a lawsuit is whether to take on a particular client. That initial decision derives its importance from the fact that professional rules prevent lawyers from simply abandoning clients if they become unhappy with the progress of the case. So Sands wants to be sure about at least two things before she takes on Peters as a client. First, she wants to know whether she can rely on his truthfulness and candor. It’s a dreadful thing for a lawyer to discover, halfway through a case, that her client has fabricated part of the story or has omitted critical facts. We will learn a bit more in Chapter 6 about an attorney’s obligation to double check her client’s claims. Second, for reasons you’ll better understand after reading Chapter 5, Sands will likely want to know whether the stakes of the case will warrant the investment it requires. In the United States today, almost all cases like Peters’s will be handled on the plaintiff’s side by a contingent fee agreement, in which the client pays nothing if the case fails but pays a percentage of any recovery to his lawyer. So Sands will care about the likely recovery in relation to the amount she will need to invest—in terms of her time and other expenses. If Peters’s only injury is a broken ankle, but the case will require multiple experts, it’s likely not worth his—or Sands’s—while to pursue it. So, to reiterate, Peters must decide if he wants to retain Sands as his lawyer, and Sands must similarly decide whether she wants to represent Peters in this matter.</p>
<p id="c05e3559-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If Peters decides to hire Sands (and Sands agrees to take Peters on as a client), Peters and Sands have to divide responsibilities. Common sense and codes of <span title="4" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-4">p. 4</span>professional ethics agree that clients make major decisions about the goals of litigation. A lawyer can get disbarred if she files suit, settles a case, or refuses a settlement without consulting her client. By contrast, questions of tactics belong to the lawyer: what court to sue in, whether to request a jury trial, how to develop the facts of the case, what evidence to present in what order, and more. A lawyer should keep her client informed about these matters and would certainly explain her thinking if a client asked, but generally would not seek a client’s permission or advice concerning them. Because tactics, including procedural tactics, lie in the hands of the lawyer, the lawyer needs, besides good judgment, a good grounding in the available procedural tools. How well Sands uses these tools may, in a close case, spell the difference between victory and defeat for Peters. As you encounter cases in this course you will have two questions to answer: What principle of law determined who prevailed in this situation?; and which lawyer picked this particular fight and why—what strategic or tactical advantage was she hoping to achieve?</p>
<p id="c05e355a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having divided responsibilities between lawyer and client, the system has to decide how to handle problems that arise from this division of responsibilities. For representation to work, the legal system has to treat the lawyer’s choices as if they were Peters’s choices. In legal and economic terms Sands is Peters’s “agent,” acting for him in the lawsuit. When Peters’s lawyer does a fine job, everyone (except Dodge) is happy. But what if she doesn’t? Suppose Sands files a suit seeking recovery for personal injuries but not for damage to Peters’s car. The legal system will treat that choice as if Peters himself had made it. But what if Sands’s behavior results not from Peters’s choice but from Sands’s carelessness—forgetting to ask Peters whether his car was damaged? In that situation, the procedural system faces a dilemma. If the system lets Sands fix her mistake by later adding the claim for property damage, it will thereby harm Dodge, who may have been relying on the original claim to be a complete statement of Peters’s grievance (and thus failed to preserve evidence showing that Peters’s car was not in fact damaged). But if the procedural system insists that Peters stand by the original version of the claim—without the claim for property damage—it will thereby harm Peters, by blocking him from recovering for damage to his car.</p>
<p id="c05e5c6b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This problem has no good solution, but the system tries to solve it in three ways. The first is to make the party who made the mistake suffer: Peters can sue Sands for malpractice if her negligence has caused him to forgo part of his recovery. The second is to tell the party suffering the harm—Dodge—that the harm really isn’t so bad, and that he should suffer the expense and inconvenience of allowing Peters to fix the mistake. Finally, the system can try to wriggle out of the problem by allowing Peters to amend his claim but granting Dodge extra time to prepare a defense. Each solution has a corresponding drawback. If the system insists that Peters is bound by his lawyer’s slip—and that his only remedy is a malpractice action—it will force him to start a second lawsuit (against his lawyer), with all the attendant uncertainty, expense, and delay. (Moreover, his lawyer may not have the assets or insurance to cover his losses.) If the system allows Peters’s lawyer to cure her slip by amending the complaint, it will undermine the efficiency that flows from treating lawyers’ actions as those of their clients and will inflict the costs of Peters’s lawyer’s sloppiness on Dodge. And if it crafts a solution that hurts neither Peters nor Dodge but <span title="5" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-5">p. 5</span>extends the litigation, it may inflict costs on other litigants by making them wait longer to have their cases resolved.</p>
<p id="c05e5c6c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because procedural choices have consequences for parties and other litigants, you will repeatedly encounter courts trying to resolve this trilemma. As you do, consider whether the choices they make are reasonable.</p>
<div class="epub-feature epub-feature1 ">
<div class="epub-feature-heading2 cc-font-medium epub-text-left"><p id="c05e5c6e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-left">WHAT’S NEW HERE?</p></div>

<p id="c05e5c6f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you’ve absorbed the preceding few pages, you have—even before encountering your first case or Rule or statute—learned something fundamental about the practice of law: that lawyers and clients stand in a relationship. Many layers of law and professional ethics define the lawyer-client relationship and most of them lie beyond the scope of this course. But each is assigned a role, and must have confidence that the other will do their part. The client, in choosing his lawyer, must keep in mind that the lawyer will be responsible for making tactical decisions about the litigation—including where to file the case, what evidence to seek, and how to present the claims—that could spell victory or defeat in the case. The lawyer, in accepting a case, must keep in mind that the client will have authority to accept or reject settlement offers, regardless of the attorney’s view of whether the case should go to trial. So—for <i>both</i> lawyer and client—it’s a very good idea to do some investigating and some thinking before entering the relationship.</p>

<p id="c05e8382-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once Peters has selected Ursula Sands as his lawyer, Sands will have to begin making procedural choices, each of which may have consequences for the outcome of the suit. One of the first such choices may not have occurred to you: where to file the case. The 50 states and the federal government all operate systems of courts, and Sands must find out whether she has a choice of courts. If she has a choice, she will have to decide which would be most advantageous.</p>
<p id="c05e8383-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why should Sands care in which state Peters’s case is heard? Convenience provides one possible answer: Recall that Peters is likely to return to Ann Arbor for classes, but Sands, his lawyer, operates out of Champaign. For Peters it would likely be more convenient to have the case heard in Ann Arbor, Michigan. For Sands, this may involve some headaches: If she is not licensed to practice in Michigan, she must refer the case to a lawyer who is. On the other hand, recall that Dodge is a long-established business owner in Champaign and Peters and his family are relative newcomers. A Champaign jury might be less sympathetic to Peters than to Dodge—in which case it may be worth Sands’s time to find that Ann Arbor lawyer. Moreover, convenience for Peters is likely to mean inconvenience for Dodge (or his insurer), a possibility that may not make Sands unhappy. Will an Ann Arbor jury—with perhaps a University of Michigan student or <span title="6" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-6">p. 6</span>two on it—be more sympathetic to Peters? Do courts in one state or the other have large case backlogs that would delay Peters’s claim? Or maybe Sands is trying to avoid a particular judge, whom she believes to be unsympathetic or ill-tempered.</p>
<p id="c05e8384-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With a sense in mind of where she might prefer to bring suit, Sands now needs to know what the possibilities are. The rules governing where a suit can be brought come under the headings of personal jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction, and venue.</p>
<div id="c05eaa95-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c05eaa96-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">1.&nbsp;Personal Jurisdiction</p></h3></div>

<p id="c05eaa97-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court in the United States cannot exercise power over a defendant—here Dodge—if doing so would “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Out of this phrase in the U.S. Constitution<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100CF_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N100CF_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">2</a></span> the United States Supreme Court has woven an elaborate doctrinal fabric that limits the power of courts over defendants. As you will see in Chapter 2, this doctrine defines the <i>personal jurisdiction</i> of courts. To condense a great deal of law into a few words, a court cannot exercise power over Dodge unless the state in which that court sits has some connection with him or with the accident that gave rise to Peters’s claim. Because Dodge lives in Illinois and the accident occurred there, courts in Illinois would have the power to hear the case, but not a court in Texas or California—unless Dodge lived there when the suit was later filed or had some other significant connection with those states.</p>
<p id="c05ed1a9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What about Michigan, where Peters goes to school? Probably not, unless Dodge consented. The doctrine of personal jurisdiction focuses on the defendant, who is being taken to court against his will. That does not mean that defendants can only be sued in their home states—but it does mean that a state cannot enter a judgment against a defendant like Dodge who has no connection with the state. So our case is almost certain to be brought in a court in Illinois.</p>

Specifically, does he have his choice between a state court and a federal court? As already noted, Sands will want to choose the court that offers her client the greatest advantages—and fewest disadvantages.</p>
<p id="c05ed1ad-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All states have at least one court of general jurisdiction that could hear Peters’s state law tort claim. In Illinois that court is the circuit court, but in other states it may be called a district court, superior court, court of common pleas, or, in New York, the Supreme Court. Thus one alternative open to Peters is the Circuit Court of Illinois.</p>
<p id="c05ef8be-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sands may also be able to file Peters’s case in federal court. If she can, some additional elements enter the calculation. All federal judges are appointed for life <span title="7" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-7">p. 7</span>(Article III of the U.S. Constitution permits their removal only by impeachment). Most state judges are subject to some electoral approval. That difference can be important in a case in which judicial insulation from political pressure may play a role (hardly likely in the Peters-Dodge case). Second, most federal districts are larger than their state equivalents (usually counties), so jurors will be drawn from a broader pool—not just Ann Arbor or Champaign but several surrounding counties. Consider how this fact might have affected the strategy of the plaintiffs’ lawyer in the next case, <i>Hawkins v. Masters Farms.</i></p>
<p id="c05ef8bf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though at this point in your study the idea may seem strange, federal courts have limited jurisdiction. Article III, §2 of the federal Constitution set the outer bounds of that jurisdiction. Within those bounds it is up to Congress to decide the precise subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts. Congress has enacted a number of statutes authorizing federal district courts (the trial courts of the federal system) to hear certain kinds of cases. The most important statutes at this point in our exploration are 28 U.S.C. §§1331 and 1332(a).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100FC_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N100FC_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">3</a></span> Read those two statutes and decide which might apply to <i>Peters v.

Masters. Plaintiffs’ claims arise from a December 8, 2000 traffic accident in which a tractor driven by Defendant Masters collided with Mr. Creal’s automobile, resulting in the death of Mr. Creal. Plaintiffs filed this action in federal court alleging the existence of diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §1332. Defendants dispute that there is complete diversity among the parties, and the matter is before the court on Defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. For the reasons set forth below, Defendants’ motion is granted.</p>

<p id="c05f6dfa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On December 8, 2000, Mr. Creal was killed in an automobile accident on Mineral Point Road, just south of Troy, Kansas, when his 1988 Chevrolet van collided with a New Holland tractor driven by Defendant Masters [a citizen of Kansas]. At the time of his death, Mr. Creal was living in Troy with his wife, Elizabeth Creal, and her children. He was approximately forty-four years old when he died.</p>
<p id="c05f6dfb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">James and Elizabeth Creal first met in St. Joseph, Missouri in November 1999. Mr. Creal had lived in St. Joseph for most of his life, while Mrs. Creal resided in Troy for the majority of her life. When the couple first met, Mr. Creal was living at his mother’s home in St. Joseph, where he had been residing since obtaining a divorce from his previous wife.</p>
<p id="c05f6dfc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beginning in January 2000, Mr. Creal began spending the night at the apartment Mrs. Creal shared with her children on South Park Street in Troy. Initially, Mr. Creal would return to his mother’s house every evening after work, shower, gather some clothes, and proceed to the apartment to retire for the evening. Mrs. Creal paid the rent for the apartment on South Park Street, while Mr. Creal contributed by buying the groceries for himself, Mrs. Creal, and her two children. Mr. and Mrs. Creal split the cost of utilities for the apartment.</p>
<p id="c05f950d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When Mrs. Creal and her children moved into an apartment on 1st Street in Troy in March 2000, Mr. Creal brought his clothes, some furniture, pictures, photo albums, and other memorabilia to the new apartment. Mr. and Mrs. Creal also purchased a bedroom set for the apartment. When they moved into the apartment, Mr. Creal stopped going to his mother’s house in St. Joseph to shower and change after work, and instead came directly back to Troy to spend the night. Also at that time, Mr. and Mrs. Creal opened a joint checking account into which Mr. Creal began depositing his paychecks to help pay the household bills. Mr. and Mrs. Creal were married in July 2000.</p>
<p id="c05f950e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In November 2000, Mr. and Mrs. Creal moved into a house on Streeter Creek Road in Troy. Mr. Creal died approximately two weeks later. His death certificate lists Kansas as his residence.</p>
<p id="c05f950f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the time Mr. and Mrs. Creal first met until Mr. Creal’s death in December 2000, Mr. Creal retained certain connections with the State of Missouri. In November 1999, he applied for a Missouri title and license for his Chevrolet van using his mother’s St. Joseph address. In December 1999, he applied for automobile insurance on the van using the same address. In March 2000, he listed the address when he took out a loan and applied for a new Missouri title on the van to name a new lien holder. In April 2000, he renewed his Missouri driver’s license for three more years under the address. In May 2000, he filled out a form for life insurance listing the address. Mr. Creal also received mail and his paycheck stubs at his mother’s house, where he <span title="9" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-9">p. 9</span>stopped by every week to visit. After his death, an estate was opened for Mr. Creal in Buchanan County, Missouri alleging that he resided at his mother’s address at the time of his death.</p>
<p id="c05f9510-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, although Mr. and Mrs. Creal left open the possibility of leaving Troy to move to a location closer to Kansas City, Missouri, such as Platte City or Faucett, Missouri, they never looked for houses elsewhere and never made any specific plans to leave. Mrs. Creal testified in deposition that she was, for the most part, satisfied living in Troy.</p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c05f9511-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">III. Discussion</p></div>
<p id="c05fbc22-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . The parties do not dispute that all Defendants are citizens of the State of Kansas and that Plaintiff Baldwin is a citizen of the State of Missouri. Although Plaintiff Hawkins, as an individual, is also a citizen of the State of Missouri, her role in this case as Personal Representative of the Estate of Mr. Creal mandates that the court focus on the citizenship of Mr. Creal at the time of his death, not the citizenship of Plaintiff Hawkins herself. 28 U.S.C. §1332(c)(2) (“[T]he legal representative of the estate of a decedent shall be deemed to be a citizen only of the same State as the decedent  . . . ”). Whether Mr. Creal was a citizen of the State of Kansas or the State of Missouri at the time of his death is the central dispute currently before the court.</p>
<p id="c05fbc23-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For purposes of determining whether diversity jurisdiction exists, a person is a “citizen” of the state in which he or she is “domiciled.” “For adults, domicile is established by physical presence in a place in connection with a certain state of mind concerning one’s intent to remain there.” Miss. Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U.S. 30, 48 (1989).</p>
<p id="c05fbc24-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the court concludes that at the time of his death, Mr. Creal had not only established a physical presence in the State of Kansas, but also displayed an intent to remain there. Although Mr. Creal lived the majority of his life in St. Joseph, Missouri, he had been living in Troy, Kansas with his wife of five months for nearly one year at the time he died. Among other things, he had moved his clothes, some furniture, pictures, photo albums, and other memorabilia into the home he shared with Mrs. Creal and her children; he contributed to household costs; and he purchased a new bedroom set with his wife. Although Mr. Creal retained some connections with the State of Missouri, the court does not find these connections sufficient to overcome the evidence that his actions from January 2000 until the time of his death demonstrated an intent to remain with his wife in the State of Kansas. In fact, the only evidence presented by Plaintiffs that directly calls Mr. Creal’s intent into question is the deposition testimony of Mrs. Creal that the couple left open the possibility of leaving Troy to move to a location like Platte City or Faucett, Missouri, but that they never looked for houses there or made any specific plans to leave. At most, Mrs. Creal’s testimony evidences a “floating intention” of Mr. Creal to return to his former domicile, which is insufficient to overcome the evidence that he was domiciled in the State of Kansas at the time of his death.</p>
<p id="c05fbc25-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In conclusion, the court has considered all of the evidence and arguments presented by the parties and holds that Mr. Creal was a citizen of the State of Kansas at the time of his death. Because Plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden of showing <span title="10" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-10">p. 10</span>that complete diversity exists among the parties, the court grants Defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="c05fbc26-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">IT IS, THEREFORE, BY THE COURT ORDERED that Defendants’ motion to dismiss is granted.</p>
<p id="c05fbc27-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case is closed.</p>

<li><p id="c05fe33a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Hawkins</i> is a quintessential case about procedure. What does that mean? For starters, the case talks not at all about whether the driver of the tractor was careless—a question that will surely matter if the case goes to trial. Instead, it focuses on an apparently strange question: of what state Mr. Creal was a “citizen”? That matters because a federal statute, 28 U.S.C. §1332, confers subject matter jurisdiction on federal district courts in controversies between “citizens of different states.” For over two centuries courts have interpreted that phrase in ways this short opinion elaborates.</p></li>
<li><p id="c05fe33b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But—and this is what makes this a quintessential procedural case—after we know the answer to this question, we will still not have resolved the question of negligence (what lawyers would call the “substantive” issue in the case).

<li class=""><p id="c060cdb1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, because there was a dispute over the facts relating to the question of jurisdiction, the court says that it considered deposition testimony as well.

Lawyers can then use portions of the transcript and exhibits from the deposition to support motions they submit to the court.

Conversely, if there was any doubt about the existence of federal diversity jurisdiction, why did plaintiffs (or, likely, their lawyer, who is probably working on a contingent fee basis) waste time and effort on a losing gamble when they could have been proceeding with state court litigation?</p>
<p id="c060f4c6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Your authors don’t know for sure the answers to these questions. But reading the depositions taken in this case offers some clues that permit speculation. The plaintiffs requested a jury trial, as is common in automobile tort cases. Troy, Kansas is the seat of Doniphan County, located in northeast Kansas; a state court jury would have been drawn from the citizens of Doniphan County. If, however, the case were brought in federal court, the jury would be drawn from a much larger population pool, one that would include a number of city-dwellers.</p>
<p id="c0611bd7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Masters, a defendant, was a long-time resident of Troy, active in civic affairs, and known to many of its residents, including Elizabeth Creal. We know that Mr. Creal was a relative newcomer. The depositions reveal some more information about Mr. Creal: His marriage to Elizabeth Creal was his fourth marriage, and he appears not to have had close relationships with his adult children from his previous marriages. Nor was he connected with the religious or civic organizations in Troy. The fatal accident occurred when Creal was returning—alone—from a solitary day spent deer hunting.</p>

<p id="c06142ed-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Then the plaintiff’s lawyer must formally notify the defendant of the suit. (It’s quite likely that informal conversations with the defendant’s insurance carrier will have suggested that a lawsuit is coming, but formal notice is necessary.) Rule 4 sets forth two basic means of notice, one inexpensive and informal, the other more expensive and formal. The inexpensive method, called waiver of service, involves mailing the defendant the complaint; if the defendant agrees to waive service the suit can proceed. The more expensive method, used if the defendant refuses to cooperate, requires the lawyer to draft a summons (an order to appear), and take it to the clerk of the court, who will sign and seal it. See Rule 4(a) and (b). The summons and complaint must then be “served”—that is, delivered to the defendant in one of the ways authorized by Rule 4—by private process servers or, in exceptional cases, a federal marshal. The expense comes because process servers require a fee for their work. See Rule 4(c). These topics are covered in more depth in Chapter 2.</p>

(“Defendant”) under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §12101 et seq. [Bridges alleged that Diesel Service dismissed him from his job as a result of a disability and thus violated the ADA.] By Order dated June 29, 1994, the Court dismissed Plaintiff’s Complaint without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. In particular, Plaintiff did not file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) until after commencement of this action. Defendant now moves for sanctions pursuant to Fed. R.

The parties do not dispute that administrative remedies must be exhausted before commencement of an action under the ADA. . . . </p>
<p id="c061901c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 11 “imposes an obligation on counsel and client analogous to the railroad crossing sign, ’Stop, Look and Listen.’ It may be rephrased, ’Stop, Think, Investigate and Research’ before filing papers either to initiate the suit or to conduct the litigation.” Gaiardo v. Ethyl Corp., 835 F.2d 479, 482 (3d Cir. 1987). Rule 11 is violated only if, at the time of signing, the signing of the document filed was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances. “The Rule does not permit the use of the ’pure heart and an empty head’ defense.” <i>Gaiardo</i>. Rather, counsel’s signature certifies the pleading is supported by a reasonable factual investigation and “a normally competent level of legal research.” Lieb v. Topstone Industries, Inc., 788 F.2d 151, 157 (3d Cir. 1986).</p>
<p id="c061b72d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court is not convinced that Plaintiff’s counsel displayed a competent level of legal research. A brief review of case law would have revealed the EEOC filing requirement. Further, an award of sanctions for failure to exhaust administrative remedies is not unprecedented.</p>
<p id="c061b72e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notwithstanding, the Court will not grant sanctions. Rule 11 is not intended as a general fee-shifting device. The prime goal of Rule 11 sanctions is deterrence of improper conduct. In this case, monetary sanctions are not necessary to deter future misconduct. Plaintiff’s counsel immediately acknowledged its error and attempted to rectify the situation by filing a charge with the EEOC and moving to place this action in civil suspense. In fact, the Complaint has been dismissed without prejudice. The Court expects that Plaintiff’s counsel has learned its lesson and will demonstrate greater diligence in future.</p>
<p id="c061b72f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further, Rule 11 sanctions should be reserved for those exceptional circumstances where the claim asserted is patently unmeritorious or frivolous.

<p id="c062055c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judge, the defendant, and the plaintiff agreed that the complaint was defective and that it would be easy to cure the defect by filing the right piece of paper with the Commission. If the defect is so minor and so easy to cure, why did the defendant <span title="16" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-16">p. 16</span>bother to file a motion for sanctions? One possibility is that the defendant hoped to collect fees for the relatively small amount of time necessary to bring the motion to dismiss. Possible, but not likely: Most judges would view such a sanctions motion as a waste of time—and think ill of the defendant’s lawyer for imposing on the court.</p>
<p id="c062055d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider another possibility. Many employment discrimination lawyers would say that the EEOC filing requirement as a precondition of suit was quite elementary, and that a lawyer unfamiliar with it was likely not familiar with this area of the law. Supposing such an assessment to be correct, consider what signals the defendant’s lawyer would be sending to the judge with this Rule 11 motion. Locate the signs in the opinion that the judge has heard those implicit signals.</p>
<p id="c062055e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the plaintiff’s attorneys’ error, the court declines to impose sanctions. Why might that be? Note that, when Bridges’s attorneys learned of the failure to exhaust, they agreed to dismiss the complaint without prejudice on the condition that defendant did not file a motion for sanctions.</p>
<p id="c062055f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The current Rule 11(c)(2)—not in effect at the time of the <i>Bridges</i> decision—requires that a party first serve his opponent with a motion for sanctions, then give her 21 days to fix the error. Only if the error remains uncorrected is the party allowed to provide the court with a copy of the motion. Were this rule followed in <i>Bridges</i>, the court would never have known of the plaintiff’s attorneys’ failure to exhaust—assuming that the plaintiff’s lawyers withdrew the complaint within the 21 days.</p>

<p id="c0622c72-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Masters Farms</i> and in <i>Bridges</i> you have encountered references to various Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. What are these Rules? Where do they come from? How are they related to other sources of law that shape civil procedure: the Constitution, statutes, and cases?</p>
<p id="c0622c73-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Briefly put, the Rules are like statutes and the Constitution in that they state general principles rather than dealing with their application in specific instances, which is the task of courts. But the Rules differ from statutes in two important ways.</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="c0622c74-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike statutes, they are not directly enacted by a legislature. Instead, Congress in 1935 empowered judges to write the Rules. A statute, 28 U.S.C. §2072 (called the Rules Enabling Act), empowers the U.S. Supreme Court to promulgate “rules of practice and procedure . . . for cases in the United States district courts.”</p></li>
<li><p id="c0625385-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Also, unlike federal statutes, which can deal with any topic concerning which the Constitution allows Congress to legislate, the Rules may <i>only</i> deal with “practice and procedure.” Emphasizing this point, 28 U.S.C. §2072(b) provides, “Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.” To give a crude example, a Rule could not establish principles governing damages for breach of contract; that would be “substantive.” A Rule could, however, tell the parties how they have to go about claiming whatever damages they have suffered; Rules 8(a)(3) <span title="17" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-17">p. 17</span>and 26(a)(1)(A)(iii) do just that. As you will learn in your studies this year, defining the boundary between substance (which the Rules may not regulate) and procedure (which they may) can be difficult, but Congress has made it clear that it wants the Rules to confine themselves to the latter. You will also notice that, in theory, a Rule could violate the Rules Enabling Act if it crossed the line and regulated a “substantive right”—if, for example, a Rule tried to establish the principles of contractual damages. The Supreme Court has never found such a violation, though on several occasions parties have argued that some Rule crossed this line.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="c0625386-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The original set of Federal Rules became effective in 1938. The Supreme Court Justices did not write the original Rules themselves nor do they now serve as the primary body considering amendments to the Rules. Instead, as provided in 28 U.S.C. §§2073-2077, a series of committees, appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, do this work. A Committee on Civil Rules, consisting of judges, lawyers, and a professor or two, considers proposed amendments to the Rules. This group circulates proposed changes, holds public hearings, revises the changes in light of the hearings, and submits the results to the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice, Procedure, and Evidence, again with members from the bench and bar. The Standing Committee further considers and refines the proposed amendments, passing them in turn to the Judicial Conference of the United States. The Conference, consisting entirely of federal judges and presided over by the chief justice, is the senior administrative body of the federal courts. Its tasks include everything from judicial discipline to assigning visiting judges, approving requests for new courthouse buildings, and passing on proposed amendments to the Rules.</p>
<p id="c0625387-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the Conference approves a change, it passes the proposed Rule to the Supreme Court. With all these layers in place, it may not be surprising to learn, first, that amending a Rule takes a long time, and, second, that the Court has rarely rejected outright a Rules amendment, although on occasion individual justices have dissented from the promulgation of a proposed Rule.</p>
<p id="c0625388-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even after all these steps the proposed Rule still is not law. Under 28 U.S.C. §2074 the Court, if it too approves the proposed change, must “transmit [it] to Congress not later than May 1 of the year in which such a rule . . . is to become effective.” Congress has until December 1 to act: If it disagrees with a proposed change it can pass a statute blocking or altering the proposed Rule. Congress has only on a very few occasions blocked or amended a Rule.</p>
<p id="c0625389-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since their promulgation in 1938 the Rules have undergone a number of revisions, some minor (adding a new holiday to the list of days that do not “count” for time limits) and some major (creating the modern class action, a change that some thought came close enough to being “substantive” that it violated the Rules Enabling Act).</p>
<p id="c062538a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After a number of decades during which the Rules and the process that produced them were seen as essentially technical, recent years have seen both individual Rules and the process surrounding them become the source of controversy. Briefly put, that controversy has taken two forms. Some have criticized specific Rules as favoring one group over another. For example, some say that the recent <span title="18" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-18">p. 18</span>changes in discovery rules came at the behest of repeat defendants (generally large public and private institutions) and will handicap those who more often find themselves as plaintiffs—those challenging the actions of such defendants. (We’ll explore this branch of the controversy more thoroughly in Chapter 7, on discovery.) The other form of criticism focuses on the courts, which, some charge, have interpreted Rules in ways unintended by the drafters and which, again, favor institutional defendants over plaintiffs. As examples, critics cite the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent reinterpretation (as the critics would have it) of Rule 8, governing pleading; and the same Court’s interpretation of Rule 23, governing class actions. As you will see in later chapters, these decisions raised barriers for plaintiffs that, critics say, betray the original principles behind the Rules and distort access to justice. In the pages that follow, we shall try to highlight such examples of controversy—we aim not to resolve these disputes, but to lay out their bases and sometimes point to data that would enable one to decide who has the stronger argument.</p>
<p id="c0627a9b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, one should note that the Rules have had an influence far beyond the courts for which they were written. Federal courts hear only 2 percent of the civil cases in the United States. But the model represented by the Rules—merger of law and equity, relaxed pleading, flexible joinder of claims and parties, and broad discovery—has deeply influenced the procedure of state courts. Though it was not the case in 1938, <i>every</i> state now uses a procedural model that embraces most of these principles. At one time, 30-plus states went so far as to adopt the “federal” Rules as their own procedural code. This trend has declined; as of 2003, one scholar found “no true replicas” of the Federal Rules adopted by any state, but concluded that “the federal model of civil procedure remains substantially influential at the state level.” John B. Oakley, <i>A Fresh Look at the Federal Rules in State Courts</i>, 3 Nev. L.J. 354 (2003). So when you are studying the Rules, you are studying the most influential procedural reform of the last 200 years. Note also that the states’ adoption of a Rules-model procedure makes state courts a forum for the political controversies just noted. To use just one example, when the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted Rule 8 (the pleading rule) in a way said to handicap plaintiffs, that interpretation bound all federal courts, but left state courts free to interpret their analogous rule in a different way. So when, in the coming pages, you read a federal court’s interpretation of a federal Rule, you might ponder whether you think a state should follow the same path or diverge from it.</p>

But even if Peters’s lawyer is entirely comfortable that the claim is well grounded in fact and in law, she must still confront the task of setting forth that claim in a formal document. What should be in a complaint? Should it contain a simple statement that Peters is suing Dodge for injuries suffered in an accident, or a detailed recitation of what each party did on the day of the accident, and a blow-by-blow account of plaintiff’s injuries and recovery? As we will explore in Chapter 6, we are now in the midst of a revived debate over that question.

<p id="c062a1b5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The [complaint, known in Maryland as a] declaration[,] alleges that [1] “on or about August 14, 1954, while the Infant Plaintiff, Ronald Bell, was riding in an automobile headed in a northerly direction on Race Road at its intersection with Pulaski Highway, both said road and highway being public highways of Baltimore County, State of Maryland, the automobile in which the infant plaintiff was riding was run into and struck by an automobile tractor-trailer outfit owned by the Defendants, Novick Transfer Company, Inc., and Katie Marie Parsons, and operated at the time by their agent, servant or employee, the Defendant, Morris Jarrett Coburn, III, in a careless, reckless and negligent manner, in a westerly direction on Pulaski Highway at the intersection aforesaid, [2] so that” the infant plaintiff was injured. The declaration also alleges the injuries and damage, and that they were “the direct result of the negligence on the part of the defendants” without any negligence on the part of the plaintiffs contributing thereto.</p>
<p id="c062c8c6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although this declaration may not be sufficient under Maryland practice, it meets the requirements of Rule 8, Fed.

<li class=""><p id="c06316f1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One school of thought says that a detailed complaint will enable courts to screen out weak claims early in the process.

<p id="c0633e06-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have thus far focused on procedural maneuvers in which the adversaries have sought to use procedural rules to gain tactical or procedural advantage. Consider the possibility that Novick Transfer’s lawyer may have outsmarted himself. Unlike <i>Hawkins v. Masters Farms</i>, Bell’s lawyer originally filed suit in a state court. The opinion tells us in passing that the very general complaint it quotes would at the time not have passed muster in Maryland state courts. But defendant, presumably seeking some tactical advantage, “removed” the case to federal court alleging that the parties were of diverse citizenship. (As you will see in Chapter 3, under some <span title="21" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-21">p. 21</span>circumstances it is possible for a defendant to reject plaintiff’s original choice of a court.)

<p id="c063b346-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once defendant receives proper notice of the complaint, attention shifts to his response—the defense of the action. In the United States in the twenty-first century, most defendants in cases like <i>Peters v. Dodge</i> will be represented by a lawyer hired by their automobile insurer.</p>
<p id="c063b347-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Liability policies typically contain two promises—that the insurer will pay damages (up to the amount of the policy limits) <i>and</i> that the insurer will provide a <span title="22" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-22">p. 22</span>legal defense. Dodge will have notified his insurer immediately after the accident (liability policies require prompt notification of accidents so the insurer’s staff can gather information with which to defend against possible claims). When Dodge is served with the complaint, he may be upset that he’s being sued, but he’ll again contact his insurer, who will inform him that the insurer will provide a lawyer. The insurer will then contact a local lawyer, with whom the insurer likely has a standing arrangement, giving the lawyer any information already in the file. The lawyer will contact Dodge directly and proceed from there with Dodge as her client. The relationship between Dodge and his attorney will mirror that between Peters and his attorney, with one important exception. Almost all liability policies give the insurer—not the insured—authority to settle the case. So an insurer could decide that Peters’s claim was strong and pay him the damages he demanded (or whatever smaller sum was agreed on), even if Dodge vehemently denied any liability. Conversely, even if Dodge wanted his insurer to enter into a quick settlement so he could focus all his attention on his ice cream shop, the insurer could decide to contest liability and litigate.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104A9_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N104A9_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">4</a></span></p>
<p id="c063da59-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assume that Dodge and his insurer do not want to settle, at least at this stage. How does Dodge’s lawyer proceed? Her first procedural task is to respond to the complaint. Although it would be possible to have a system in which a defendant was not required to do anything until trial, both the Federal Rules and state codes of procedure require some response by the defendant. Generally, that response takes one of two forms: a <i>motion</i> attacking the complaint in some way or a pleading responding to the allegations in the complaint (usually called an <i>answer</i>).</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="c063da5a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">

<p id="c063da5c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Motions</i> is lawyer-talk for requests that a court do something; lawyers speak of “moving” or of “making a motion” to have the court take some step—dismiss the case, require an adversary to disclose certain information, enter judgment on a verdict, and so on. At the early stages of litigation, there are several motions that a defendant may make to end the case or to alter its shape, set out in Rule 12(b).</p>
<p id="c063da5d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There may be reasons, having nothing to do with the merits of the claim, why a case should be dismissed. These reasons typically relate to the court in which the action is brought or the method by which the defendant was brought into that court. For example, the defendant may contend that the case should be dismissed because it does not belong in federal court (subject matter jurisdiction); such a motion prompted the decision in <i>Hawkins v. Masters Farms</i>, the first case in this chapter. See Rule 12(b)(1).</p>
<p id="c063da5e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="23" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-23">p. 23</span>The defendant may also say that, even if everything in the complaint is true, under the substantive law plaintiff has no right to relief. An obvious if unrealistic example is a complaint that alleges that the defendant made a face at the plaintiff or that the defendant drove a car of an offensive color. At common law, the defendant would <i>demur</i> to such claims; now we say that the defendant moves to dismiss on the ground that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. See Rule 12(b)(6). The opinion you read in <i>Bell v. Novick Transfer</i> was written in response to the defendant’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion.</p>
<p id="c063da5f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice an important characteristic of these pre-answer motions: <i>They take no position on the truth or falsity of plaintiff’s factual allegations</i> (for example, that Dodge was driving negligently). That, as you will see in a moment, is the job of the answer.</p>

If there is a hearing, the judge will typically have read the motion papers beforehand. The judge will either hear oral argument from the lawyers or ask them questions about any aspects of the case not clear from the papers. She may decide the motion on the spot or she may reserve her ruling, making it after additional thought or research. Sometimes a judge will issue a tentative ruling based on the papers, which is given to the lawyers when they arrive for the hearing. The judge then allows the losing party to argue against the tentative ruling.</p></li>

<p id="c0644f9a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast to a pre-answer motion, an <i>answer</i>, as the name suggests, does respond to the allegations of the complaint, paragraph by paragraph. There are only two essential variations on the answer:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="c0644f9b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the most common response to a complaint, the defendant denies the truth of one or more of the allegations of the complaint, or, if after reasonable investigation the defendant does not know whether an allegation is true, he may deny the allegation. See Rule 8(b). (At common law, this move was called a <i>traverse</i><span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10530_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10530_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">5</a></span>; today it’s a <i>denial</i>.) The defendant will also likely admit some of the facts in the complaint, for example, the day the accident occurred, or the citizenship of the parties.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0644f9d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant may want to assert defenses that will wholly or partially defeat plaintiff’s claim. For example, the defendant may contend that the applicable statute of limitations has run or that the plaintiff has released her claim. At common law, such matters were called <i>confession and avoidance</i>; today we call them <i>affirmative defenses</i>. See Rule 8(c).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0644f9e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant may also wish to assert a claim against the plaintiff that would entitle him to relief. These are called <i>counterclaims</i>. See Rule 13.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="c0644f9f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Turning to Peters’s case, let us suppose that Dodge’s attorney decides there is no question relating to personal jurisdiction and that there are no problems with notice or service of process. On the other hand, Dodge may very well believe that the federal court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the claim because the parties are not diverse (as in <i>Hawkins</i>). Dodge probably will want to deny certain allegations of the complaint, such as the allegation that he was negligent. He also may want to allege various affirmative defenses to Peters’s claims. For example, in such a case it is quite common for a defendant to claim that the plaintiff’s contributory negligence was, at least in part, the cause of the accident. Such contributory negligence will act as a complete or partial defense to recovery. And, if Dodge was injured or his vehicle damaged in the accident, he will want to assert a counterclaim<i>,</i> alleging Peters’s negligence caused injuries to Dodge, which could enable Dodge to get compensation for his injuries and property damage. Indeed, as you will discover in Chapter 12, if Dodge has a counterclaim arising from the accident, he <i>must</i> assert it in his answer, or lose it.</p>

<p id="c0653a21-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In discussing complaints and answers, we have been speaking of what the Rules call “pleadings”; Rule 7(a) contains a complete list. The Federal Rules reject the view that the case is set in stone once the pleadings are completed. Instead, the Rules reflect a liberal policy toward changes (called <i>amendments</i>) to the pleadings. The discovery rules, which enable parties to gather information about the case, would mean little if new information could not be reflected in amended pleadings. For example, the <i>Peters v. Dodge</i> complaint assumes that Dodge was both the owner and driver of the vehicle. Discovery might reveal that Dodge’s daughter holds title to the vehicle (suppose Dodge bought the car as a graduation present for the daughter, but was borrowing it for the day while his own car was in the shop). Under the substantive law, owners of a vehicle are liable for accidents negligently caused by a permissive driver. Having learned of this circumstance, Peters’s lawyer could seek to amend the complaint to add Dodge’s daughter as a defendant.</p>
<p id="c0653a22-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 15(a) sets forth the basic amendment rules and states that “[t]he court should freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.” What this seemingly simple phrase means is open to interpretation, as we will see in Chapter 6. Rule 15(c) deals with amendments that add a new claim or party after the statute of limitations has run.</p>

Second, who <i>must</i> be joined as a plaintiff or a defendant in the lawsuit? See Rule 19. Third, are there persons who are not in the lawsuit who can join as parties if they so choose?

<p id="c065884e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On April 27, 2007, defendants filed a Motion to Sever pursuant to Rules 20 and 21, Fed. R. Civ. P., seeking to splinter the trial of these proceedings (which is slated for the August 2007 trial term) into five separate trials, one for each plaintiff. Defendants ground their Motion on assertions that a common trial would be inefficient and prejudicial. Plaintiffs oppose the Motion, arguing that severing the plaintiffs’ essentially identical claims would effect great inefficiency, undue delay and undue expense, while also burdening the Court with presiding over a largely similar trial five times in a row.</p>

<p id="c065af64-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants articulate four different grounds for their contention that severance of each plaintiff’s claims from each other plaintiff’s claims for trial purposes is appropriate. In particular, defendants argue that (i) plaintiffs’ claims do not arise from the same transaction or occurrence; (ii) plaintiffs will rely on individualized evidence to prove their claims; (iii) defendants will invoke individual-specific defenses; and (iv) a common trial will be prejudicial to defendants.</p>
<p id="c065af65-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first three of defendants’ contentions logically should be considered together, because they all are fundamentally challenges to the efficiency of trying all five plaintiffs’ claims in a single trial. . . . </p>
<p id="c065af66-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plainly, to conduct a single joint trial would be a strategy marked by both efficiencies, inasmuch as the issues of common proof need only be presented and decided once, and inefficiencies, inasmuch as there will be a certain degree of unique evidence and argument as to each plaintiff’s claims that is not germane to the other plaintiffs’ claims. . . . After careful consideration of the respective arguments of counsel, the Court is persuaded that, while neither approach is optimal, the interests of efficiency would be best served by keeping the plaintiffs’ claims together for trial in their present consolidated posture. The Court anticipates that there will be substantial overlapping background evidence for all plaintiffs’ claims concerning the environmental history and activities of the Ciba plant, and the interactions of Ciba with the media, government regulators, and alleged co-conspirators. Moreover, plaintiffs have argued, and defendants have not disputed, that it is probable that the same roster of nine expert witnesses (three for plaintiffs and six for defendants), all of whom live out of state, will be called to testify with respect to each plaintiff’s claims. To require these nine experts (not to mention counsel, many of whom live in Texas and Louisiana) to travel to Mobile, Alabama five times in quick succession (or to sit and wait in a hotel for days on end) to testify in five different trials would be financially foolhardy and needlessly wasteful of the parties’ economic resources, potentially even rendering these trials cost-prohibitive.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106C9_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N106C9_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">6</a></span> Moreover, if these nine experts would be testifying to substantially similar, partially overlapping opinions in each of these five trials, the attendant drag on the efficient administration of justice would be considerable, as this Court would be subjected to something akin to a judicial <i>Groundhog Day.</i> Under the specific circumstances of this case, it appears far preferable from a judicial economy standpoint to hear all of the evidence once, including both common and plaintiff-specific facts, in a single trial proceeding than to hear the common evidence five times, with plaintiff-specific testimony being confined to <span title="30" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-30">p. 30</span>each plaintiff’s individual trial. Accordingly, the Court finds that considerations of efficiency and delay do not militate in favor of severance.</p>
<p id="c065d678-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants also maintain that a joint trial would be “extremely prejudicial” to them. This objection is apparently threefold, to-wit: (a) a multiplicity of plaintiff-specific facts will confuse the jury; (b) to the extent that one plaintiff’s claims are stronger than the others’, evidence as to that plaintiff may unfairly taint the jury as to the other plaintiffs’ claims; and (c) consolidation for trial will allow plaintiffs to “bolster [ ] their individually weak cases by a suggestion that contamination is widespread.” None of these considerations are persuasive. . . . Federal juries are routinely asked to parse facts that are relevant to particular claims or particular parties, and are able to do so without difficulty so long as counsel presents the evidence in a cogent, orderly fashion that makes clear which evidence attaches to which particular claims or defenses. Furthermore, defendants’ “taint” argument disregards the ready availability of limiting instructions (should counsel draft and propose same) . . . as well as pattern charges stressing that the claims and defenses of each party must be considered separately and independently from those of each other party. There is no reason to believe that a jury would be unwilling or unable to follow such instructions in this case; therefore, defendants’ protestations of prejudice are misplaced.</p>
<p id="c065d679-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, as for defendants’ stated concern that the joinder of plaintiffs’ claims in one trial might give rise to a suggestion that contamination from the Ciba plaint is widespread, the Court fully anticipates that plaintiffs’ evidence—whether presented in one trial or five trials—will be that the alleged contamination is, in fact, widespread. Thus, this “suggestion” will be before the jury in plaintiffs’ evidentiary submission at trial, irrespective of whether severance is granted.</p>
<p id="c065d67a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In short, the Court finds that defendants have failed to make a showing of prejudice sufficient to justify the heavy burden that would be visited on the litigants and this Court alike by virtue of the proposed fragmentation of the plaintiffs’ claims into five overlapping trials.</p>

<p id="c065fd94-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether five plaintiffs can bring their claims against defendants in one case or must file five separate lawsuits may seem mundane, akin to the question of whether to drive separate cars to a restaurant or carpool. Either way, one may assume, each of the plaintiffs are equally likely to have their day in court. Yet this may not be so. Note that it would cost $3,000 to have the plaintiffs’ experts testify at one trial; five trials would raise the experts’ expenses to $15,000. Note also that four of the five plaintiffs’ properties at issue in the case are valued at less than $3,000. So a decision to sever the cases might well mean that it would be prohibitively expensive for four of the five plaintiffs to proceed to trial. Now consider the defendants’ perspective on joinder. Presumably, these cost considerations are among the very reasons defendants oppose joinder. Additionally, defending against five plaintiffs with similar claims of environmental contamination would be far more challenging than addressing the cases one by one; particularly if, as the opinion suggests, defendants believe some of the plaintiffs’ claims are stronger than others.</p>
<p id="c065fd95-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 20 gives you just a taste of the possibilities and problems created by joinder of parties. For now it is enough to understand that broad joinder of parties is one of the distinctive marks of modern civil procedure. You will get a much more comprehensive view of joinder in Chapter 12.</p>

<p id="c065fd98-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If relaxed pleading and broad joinder comprise two foundational characteristics of modern procedure, the third would be extensive discovery. Questions of jurisdiction, pleading, and parties typically arise at what may be called the “pleading stage” of a lawsuit, so called because most of the questions emerge in the process of drafting or challenging complaints or answers. During discovery, parties seek out facts to support or deny their usually contradictory allegations about what happened.</p>
<p id="c065fd99-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Do not equate “discovery,” the legal machinery for unearthing information that comes after the pleading stage, with fact investigation. Before drafting a complaint or answer, the parties must do some investigation regarding the facts underlying the suit. Lawyers can gather those facts in any of the ways in which ordinary citizens, unaided by official sanction, find out about things—through observation, personal knowledge, conversations with anyone who will talk to them, Internet searches, and public records requests. (Ethical rules do, though, prevent lawyers from speaking with people represented by counsel without their lawyer present.) Before the Federal Rules there was limited provision for discovery, and so factual development largely came about through these types of informal efforts by the parties. Much of it still does. This type of factual investigation is not set out in the Rules, and is consequently often overlooked in Civil Procedure courses. Let us take a moment to consider its benefits and limitations.</p>
<p id="c065fd9a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="32" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-32">p. 32</span>For example, in the Peters-Dodge case, assume that one of the issues in the suit is the seriousness of Peters’s injuries. Peters has been active on his college’s basketball team and claims that he cannot play for at least the remainder of the season. Upton (Dodge’s counsel) can speak to coaches and the athletic department about Peters’s performance pre-accident and post-accident, if they are willing to speak with her. She can search for online evidence of Peters’s participation in basketball games—including whatever he might post about himself on social media. And she might be able to hire a photographer to stand on the edge of the court where Peters’s team practices. But she would run afoul of the law were she to tap his telephone or install hidden cameras in his dorm room.</p>
<p id="c065fd9b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many cases, however, private inquiry by the parties simply won’t uncover key information. For example, neither Peters nor Dodge is likely to voluntarily provide information to opposing counsel, and Dodge’s likelihood of obtaining information from witnesses aligned with Peters—his parents, friends, or coach—is low. Even more neutral witnesses may be reluctant to become involved in litigation or to produce information without legal compulsion. Accordingly, the Rules provide mechanisms for a party to obtain information about the case both from other parties in the case and from third parties not in the case. These rules are grouped under the heading of <i>discovery</i>.</p>
<p id="c065fd9c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The discovery rules are a major innovation of modern procedure (though they have antecedents in earlier practices). They are also a source of much dispute, both among the parties seeking and resisting discovery and among commentators debating whether the effort and expense involved in discovery yields real returns to the parties, the judicial system, or society at large.</p>
<p id="c065fd9d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rules 26-37 and 45 give parties broad powers of investigation, backed by court-imposed sanctions. Rule 26(a)(1) requires a party, without being asked, to disclose certain basic information supporting that party’s claims or defenses—names of witnesses, the existence of documents, bases for damage calculations, and the like.</p>
<p id="c06624ae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beyond these <i>disclosures</i>, the parties may seek additional information through several means: asking written questions (<i>interrogatories</i>) of parties to the suit (Rule 33); requiring the production of records from parties to the suit (Rule 34) and from others (Rule 45(a)(1)(A)(iii)); asking parties and witnesses oral questions under oath (<i>depositions</i>) (Rules 30 and 45); and compelling physical or mental examinations (Rule 35).</p>
<p id="c06624af-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice that a party to a civil lawsuit may be compelled to provide the other side with information that weakens his claim or defense; not surprisingly, parties are often reluctant to produce such information and often try to use procedural tools to avoid doing so.</p>
<p id="c06624b0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three restrictions limit the otherwise broad powers of civil discovery. First, parties may discover only evidence that is <i>relevant</i> to a claim or defense in the case and <i>proportional</i> to the needs of the case. Rule 26(b). Second, even if relevant, the requested information may be protected if <i>privileged</i>. Rule 26(b). For example, the privilege against self-incrimination, and attorney-client and doctor-patient privileges, may bar discovery even of relevant information. Third, even relevant, unprivileged information may be undiscoverable if a party can convince a court that one of the limitations in Rules 26(b)(2)(C) or 26(c) applies; if, for example, the discovery sought is “unreasonably cumulative or duplicative,” or its potential for “annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense” outweighs its evidentiary value.</p>
<p id="c06624b1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="33" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-33">p. 33</span>Several of these limitations are at issue in the next case. One bit of background may be helpful before reading the next case. In addition to federal district judges, Congress has provided for the appointment of a group of magistrate judges to assist district court judges in their work. District court judges typically assign magistrates to resolve discovery disputes, oversee settlement, and do other tasks described as “non-dispositive” (meaning rulings that will not, in themselves, end a case). Magistrate Judge Carman was referred the defendant’s motion to compel discovery in <i>Gordon v. T.G.R. Logistics, Inc.</i>, and issued the order that follows.</p>

<p id="c0664bcf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The court quotes Rule 26(b)(1).]</p>
<p id="c0664bd0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are three basic steps for the court to consider when determining the appropriate scope of discovery under Rule 26(b)(1). Those steps are: (1) is the information <span title="34" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-34">p. 34</span>privileged; (2) is it relevant to a claim or defense; and (3) is it proportional to the needs of the case. There being no claim of privilege asserted herein, this matter will resolve with a review of the final two criteria.</p>
<p id="c0664bd1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The courts have a long history of attempting to define the proper scope of discovery. The federal discovery rules were initially adopted in 1938 and have been described as a striking and imaginative departure from tradition. In the 1980s it became apparent that excessive discovery was becoming a problem. . . . With the amendments of the Rules beginning in 1983, the issue of proportionality was introduced into the scope of discovery evaluations.</p>
<p id="c0664bd2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This effort to properly limit the scope of discovery comes at a time when the amount of available data for discovery is growing exponentially. More data has been created in the last two years than in the entire previous history of the human race and the amount of data is predicted to grow 10-fold by 2020. A great deal of that data will involve social media.</p>
<p id="c0664bd3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Social media presents some unique challenges to courts in their efforts to determine the proper scope of discovery of relevant information and maintaining proportionality. While it is conceivable that almost any post to social media will provide some relevant information concerning a person’s physical and/or emotional health, it also has the potential to disclose more information than has historically occurred in civil litigation. While we can debate the wisdom of individuals posting information which has historically been considered private, we must recognize people are providing a great deal of personal information publicly to a very loosely defined group of “friends,” or even the entire public internet. People have always shared thoughts and feelings, but typically not in such a permanent and easily retrievable format. No court would have allowed unlimited depositions of every friend, social acquaintance, co-employee or relative of a plaintiff to inquire as to all disclosures, conversations or observations. Now far more reliable disclosures can be obtained with a simple download of a social media history. A few clicks on the computer and you shortly have what can consist of hundreds of pages of recorded postings and conversations of a party. There can be little doubt that within those postings there will be information which is relevant to some issue in the litigation. It is equally clear that much of the information will be irrelevant.</p>
<p id="c0664bd4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Just because the information can be retrieved quickly and inexpensively does not resolve the issue. Discovery can be burdensome even as it is inexpensive. Courts have long denied discovery of information which was easy to obtain, but which was not discoverable. “The court may, for good cause, issue an order to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1). Upon a finding of good cause a court may prohibit the production of relevant information. The recent inclusion of proportionality within Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) further emphasizes this point.</p>
<p id="c06672e5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Defendant correctly observes that there would be very little time or expense involved in the initial production of Plaintiff’s Facebook history. That’s true on the front end. The problem is that such vast information has the potential to generate additional discovery or impact trial testimony. It’s not difficult to imagine a plaintiff being required to explain every statement contained within a lengthy Facebook history in which he or she expressed some degree of angst or emotional distress or discussing life events which could be conceived to cause emotional upset, but which is extremely personal and embarrassing. . . . That being said, Defendant has a legitimate interest in discovery which is important to the claims and damages it is being asked <span title="35" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-35">p. 35</span>to pay. Information in social media which reveals that the plaintiff is lying or exaggerating his or her injuries should not be protected from disclosure. . . . </p>
<p id="c06672e6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant, in apparent recognition that its initial request was overly broad, has offered to limit its request for social media temporally for three years prior to the motor vehicle accident to present. Defendant asserts that it will be unable to defend Plaintiff’s damage claims without access to information regarding Plaintiff’s emotional state prior to the accident. In this Court’s opinion that is casting the net too wide. . . . From what has been presented this case is . . . [a] “garden variety” emotion[al] distress claim. . . . Granting access to Plaintiff’s entire Facebook history would provide minimal relevant information while exposing substantial irrelevant information. As such the discovery would exceed the proper limits of proportionality.</p>
<p id="c06672e7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Defendant’s claim that it would be unable to challenge Plaintiff’s damage claims is exaggerated. Defendants have been effectively defending such garden variety emotional distress claims for many years and such claims typically make up a small part of the damages in physical injury cases. The Plaintiff also alleges a traumatic brain injury. Such damages have long been a subject of the evaluation and diagnosis by experts using proven testing protocols. . . . Therefore the Court will deny Defendant’s request for social media discovery prior to the date of the accident of June 28, 2015. Nevertheless, the Court is not convinced that all relevant social media subsequent to that date has been produced. The Plaintiff will be required to produce all relevant history which addresses Plaintiff’s significant emotional turmoil, any mental disability or ability, or relate significant events which could reasonably be expected to result in emotional distress.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN107F4_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N107F4_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span> Plaintiff will also be required to produce all Facebook postings which reference the accident, its aftermath, and any of her physical injuries related thereto, insofar as such has not already been produced by Plaintiff. In its reply brief Defendant discusses the impact of Plaintiff’s injuries on activities she enjoyed before the accident. The Court has not been provided any guidance as to what activities of the Plaintiff may have been impacted by this accident. The Court will order the production of Facebook history and photos which relate or show the Plaintiff’s level of activity after the accident.</p>

Finally, the court’s order to compel requires production of all Facebook history and photos on or after the date of the accident that relate to the accident and her resulting injuries, or describe any other emotional turmoil, mental disability, emotionally distressing events, or physical activities. Courts have great discretion to adjust the scope of discovery requests as a means of achieving a just outcome.</p></li>

<p id="c066c11d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Imagine that the <i>Peters v. Dodge</i> case survives the pleading stage and the parties engage in discovery. After submitting document requests and taking depositions of witnesses and each other, the parties gather all of the information that they can about the underlying facts of the case. There is, then, another opportunity for a court to decide whether the case should proceed to trial: <i>summary judgment.</i></p>
<p id="c066c11e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 56(a) requires that a court should grant summary judgment when there is “no genuine dispute as to any material fact.”</p>
<p id="c066c11f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What does that mean? Suppose in <i>Peters v. Dodge</i> that Dodge moves for summary judgment and asserts that the collision occurred at the intersection of Main and Walnut Streets, and that the light was green for Walnut traffic (Dodge’s street) and red for Main traffic, where Peters was driving. To support the motion, Dodge submits his own affidavit stating that the Walnut light was green and submits the affidavit of a truck driver who was immediately behind Peters on Main saying that the light on Main was red. On this showing, with no evidence to the contrary offered by Peters, most courts would grant summary judgment for Dodge. There is no dispute that Dodge’s light was green and Peters’s light was red. No reasonable jury could conclude, given these facts, that Dodge was in the wrong.</p>
<p id="c066c120-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What if, instead, Peters submitted his own affidavit in opposition stating that he had the green light? At that point we have a factual issue for trial: Who was accurately perceiving and telling the truth about the traffic lights? In such a situation, a court would deny Dodge’s motion for summary judgment. The court would reason that summary judgment is not for weighing evidence but for determining whether there is any evidence to weigh; the conflicting affidavits would establish that there was an issue for trial.</p>

His wife, Alice Houchens, is trying to collect upon either of two life insurance policies issued by American, which covered Mr. Houchens. One policy was an occupational accidental injury and death insurance policy. The other policy was a non-occupational accident insurance policy. . . . Both policies required that the insured’s death be caused by accident in order to be covered.</p>

The State Department, the FBI, ICAO, Mrs. Houchens, and the Red Cross have searched for him to no avail. In 1988, Mrs. Houchens brought an action to declare Mr. Houchens legally dead under Virginia law. On April 29, 1988, an order was issued by the Circuit Court of Loudoun County, Virginia, declaring that Mr. Houchens is presumed to have died between August 15 and August 29, 1980.</p>
<p id="c0670f4d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Houchens sued American for breach of contract because American refused to pay under either of two accidental death policies covering Mr. Houchens, which were issued by American.

Va. Code Ann. §64.1-105 (1987). Therefore, Mr. Houchens is presumed to be dead, and Mrs. Houchens is entitled to that presumption. However, in order for Mrs. Houchens to recover under the American <span title="39" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-39">p. 39</span>policies, she must prove that Mr. Houchens died as a result of an accident. The term “accident” is not defined in the policies. In such cases, the courts of Virginia have said that an accident is an “event that takes place without one’s foresight or expectation; an undesigned, sudden, and unexpected event.” Harris v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co., 222 Va. 45, 46 (1981) (quoting Ocean Accident &amp; Guaranty Corp. v. Glover, 165 Va. 283, 285 (1935)).</p>

Ins. Co. of Tennessee v. Daniel, 209 Va. 332, 335 (1968). Therefore, the burden is on Mrs. Houchens to prove that her husband died by accidental means.</p>
<p id="c0670f51-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court granted summary judgment to American in this case under the rationale of Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 (1986). The Supreme Court set out the standard for granting summary judgment as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0670f52-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our view, the plain language of Rule 56[(a)] mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0670f54-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellate court, therefore, must reverse the grant of summary judgment if it appears from the record that there is an unresolved issue of material fact; the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts contained in the materials before the trial court must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0670f55-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">838 F.2d 729, 734 (4th Cir. 1988). On this appeal, then, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to Houchens to ascertain whether she made a sufficient showing that Mr. Houchens died accidentally.</p>
<p id="c0670f56-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mrs. Houchens asserts that the presumption that Mr. Houchens is dead somehow translates into the presumption that he died accidentally; therefore, she made a sufficient showing. She relies upon three cases from the western part of the country as support for the fact that she met her burden. [The court described these cases—<i>Martin, Englehart</i>, and <i>Valley National</i>.]</p>
<p id="c0670f57-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These three cases are readily distinguishable from the case at bar. Here, there is only evidence of a disappearance. Mr. Houchens went to Bangkok and was never heard from again. There are no bizarre circumstances surrounding his disappearance. He was not last seen in a position of peril as in <i>Martin</i>. He simply vanished. The circumstances surrounding his disappearance do not give us a clue that he actually died, as did the circumstances in <i>Martin, Englehart</i>, and <i>Valley National</i>. Viewed in the light most favorable to Mrs. Houchens, we can only conclude that Mr. Houchens disappeared, and then presume that he died under Virginia law. We cannot conclude that he died accidentally. . . . </p>

Mr. Houchens might have died accidentally. However, it is equally likely that he was murdered, that he died of natural causes, that he took his own life, or that he just went away somewhere and lives yet. “It is our function . . . to ascertain whether the evidence, considered in the light most favorable toward plaintiff affords room for men of reasonable minds to conclude that there is a greater probability that the ultimate fact did happen than that it did not happen.” [quoting one of the distinguishable cases]. The ultimate fact at issue here is whether the death occurred by accident. We cannot conclude that there is a greater probability that the death was caused by accident than by other means.</p>
<p id="c0673569-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Virginia Supreme Court gave guidance in this area in General Accident &amp; Casualty Corp. v. Murray, 120 Va. 115, [126] (1916). There the court wrote:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c067356a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The right to recover upon the policy sued on must be established by a preponderance of the evidence deduced in the case, and not be based merely upon conjecture, guess or random judgment, that is, upon mere supposition without a single known fact.</p>
<p id="c067356b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The [burden is upon plaintiff] to bring herself within the provisions of the contract of insurance by proving an accidental injury to the assured, and there is no presumption to aid her in this proof, since the well-established rule of law, according to all the authorities, is, that when death occurs it is presumed to be the result of natural dissolution rather than of accidental injury. . . . </p>

<p id="c067356d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To summarize, Houchens relies on the presumption given her by §64-1.105 of the Virginia Code to establish that Mr. Houchens is dead. She then relies upon the facts surrounding his disappearance as a basis for a jury finding that his death was accidental. However, the meager circumstances would not allow a jury to reasonably conclude that it is more likely that Mr. Houchens died from an accident than in some other manner. Because of the sparse evidence concerning his disappearance, we cannot say that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of American under the <i>Celotex</i> standard.

<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0675c87-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose Mrs. Houchens produced a witness, a former college friend of Mr. Houchens who had not seen him for more than ten years. The friend is prepared to testify that, while vacationing in Thailand during the time in question, he saw Mr. Houchens (or someone who looked like him) hit by a bus in a busy intersection. He caught only a brief glimpse; moreover, his vision is not good. The Thai police have no record of a bus accident on the day in question. Can Mrs. Houchens avoid summary judgment with this showing?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0675c88-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What if, in response to Mrs. Houchens’s production of the witness above, the insurance company comes forward with two affidavits, from two Thai government officials, stating that Mr. Houchens was shot and killed by Thai police when they intercepted a drug smuggling effort. (Assume that such a death would not be accidental, as the Virginia courts define that term.) In support of these affidavits, the Thai officials state that they are prepared to produce Mr. Houchens’s passport. The judge is then faced with conflicting affidavits—one from the near-sighted former roommate, the other from Thai government officials. Summary judgment for the insurer?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0675c89-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, what if, as in <i>Houchens</i> itself, neither side had been able to find information about the circumstances of Mr. Houchens’s death. But assume that Virginia law specified that seven years’ unexplained absence would give rise to a presumption of death, and, in the absence of contrary evidence, such <span title="42" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-42">p. 42</span>presumed death would be further presumed to be accidental. Summary judgment for the insurer? For Mrs. Houchens?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0675c8a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the first two scenarios, Mrs. Houchens should be able to defeat the summary judgment motion. Even if Mrs. Houchens’s witness does not seem particularly credible, credibility is not for the judge to assess. Juries should assess material factual disputes. In the third scenario, Mrs. Houchens would probably win summary judgment herself, not because the facts are different but because the law has stepped in.</p></li>

</li>
<li class=""><p id="c0675c8b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One aspect of <i>Houchens</i> having nothing to do with summary judgment may have puzzled you: The case is heard in federal court, but the court mostly discusses Virginia law (and that of other states); why not federal law? The answer, as you will see in Chapter 4, is that in <i>Erie Railroad v. Tompkins</i>, a leading constitutional opinion, the Supreme Court held that in a case that is in federal court only because of diversity jurisdiction, state <i>substantive</i> law applies. According to this line of cases, Virginia substantive law, including such matters as presumptions of death, governs. The law of other states comes into the picture because the federal court apparently believes that Virginia courts would look to them as persuasive, though not binding, authority.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="c0675c8c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are other methods of pretrial disposition that should be briefly mentioned here. In some cases, defendant will fail to answer the complaint entirely, or will otherwise fail to defend, and a <i>default judgment</i> will be granted. See Rule 55. Similarly, if plaintiff does not obey an order of the court during the proceedings, a <i>dismissal</i> may be granted. The most common reasons for dismissal are persistent failure to comply with discovery orders, failure to prosecute the case, and failure to appear for calendar calls, motions, or pretrial conferences. See Rule 41(b). In addition, plaintiff may seek a so-called <i>voluntary dismissal</i> of the case if the case settles or, for some reason, he thinks that he would be better off starting over. See Rule 41(a). We discuss these matters in more detail later; for now, you simply should be aware of their existence.</p>

<p id="c067839f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All pretrial activities, from pleading through summary judgment, anticipate the ultimate trial, yet few cases actually reach that point. Fewer than 5 percent of all cases commenced in the federal courts go to trial. Nevertheless, the trial process exercises a dominant influence on pretrial behavior because during the pretrial period the parties have to gather all the information that would be necessary at trial if it did occur. Moreover, for the majority of cases that settle, they do so on terms dictated by the parties’ estimates of what the outcome at trial would be, estimates shaped by the information gathered in the pretrial phase.</p>
<p id="c06783a0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If trial does occur, it consists of an elaborate pattern of symmetrical opportunities for the parties to present their cases. Plaintiff will have an opportunity to make an opening statement, following which defendant will get the same opportunity. <span title="43" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-43">p. 43</span>Plaintiff can then present his case offering witnesses and documents; defendant can cross-examine each of plaintiffs’ witnesses to test their recollection and credibility. Defendant can then present his evidence, with plaintiff having the same opportunity for cross-examination. It all ends with both parties making closing statements. This pattern reflects two principles: that parties (not, as in many other systems, the judge) are responsible for proof; and that the party going first bears the burden of producing evidence and of persuading the trier of fact that his version of the case is more likely than not to be true.</p>
<p id="c06783a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In U.S. courts, that trier of fact will sometimes be a jury. The Seventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and comparable provisions in state constitutions demonstrate a strong commitment to the idea of civil jury trial, an almost uniquely American institution.</p>
<p id="c06783a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But that ideal has limits. Just as a judge may head off trial entirely by granting summary judgment, at trial a judge may refuse to submit a case to a jury or, after a jury has rendered its verdict, may grant judgment notwithstanding the verdict. See Rule 50(a). Under what circumstances should a judge grant such a motion for “judgment as a matter of law”? There is general agreement that if a party who has the burden of proof on an issue offers no evidence at all on that issue, judgment must be directed against him. There is similar agreement in cases in which the party with the burden of proof offers evidence that is simply too weak for any reasonable juror to believe. But what about a case involving evidence that, although weak, conceivably could be credited?</p>
<p id="c06783a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts insist that it is the jury’s job to evaluate the credibility of witnesses and that, in passing on such motions, they will not consider whether witnesses are telling the truth. Courts are equally firm, however, in their belief that the function of judgment as a matter of law is to avoid (or overrule) jury deliberations in cases in which a jury could reasonably come to only one verdict. The next case involves a collision of these two principles. It uses two different terms for different stages at which the power of taking a case from the jury is exercised: “directed verdict,”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109EE_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N109EE_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">8</a></span> to describe the exercise of judicial power before the case is given to the jury; and “judgment notwithstanding the verdict” to describe post-verdict reversal of the jury’s decision.</p>

<p id="c067aabc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Norton was, and still is, in the commercial lawn mowing business. He bought a Snapper riding mower in July 1981. On January 24, 1983, Norton was using this mower to clear leaves from a yard . . . adjacent to a creek. At the end of his third circular route through the yard, he drove up an incline, traveling in the direction away from the creek. Norton testified that as he reached the top of the incline, approximately six feet from the creek, the mower began to slide backwards toward the creek. Norton says he applied the brakes, but he continued to slide backwards. The lawn mower, with Norton still aboard, crashed into the creek. Norton testified that he kept both hands on the handle bars until the impact of the mower hitting the water knocked him off the seat. . . . [A]t some point during this crash, Norton’s hand was caught in the lawn mower’s blades, thereby amputating four of his fingers. It is not known . . . precisely how the injury occurred. . . . </p>
<p id="c067aabd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the close of the plaintiff’s case, and again at the close of all evidence, Snapper moved for a directed verdict. The court dismissed Norton’s negligence and warranty claims, but left the strict liability “defect” claim for the jury. The jury returned a verdict for Norton, holding Snapper liable for 80% of the injuries.</p>
<p id="c067aabe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Immediately after dismissing the jury, the district court indicated it would enter a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>

<p id="c067d1d1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The test for granting a judgment notwithstanding the verdict is the same as the test for granting a directed verdict. The court considers the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and should grant the judgment notwithstanding the verdict only where the evidence so strongly and so favorably points in the favor of the moving party that reasonable people could not arrive at a contrary verdict. . . . </p>
<p id="c067d1d2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issues in this case were: (1) whether the failure to install “dead man” devices rendered the 1981 Snapper mower defective; and (2) if the lawn mower was defective, whether the lack of a “dead man” control caused Norton’s injury. . . . </p>
<p id="c067d1d3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Norton claims the Snapper mower was unreasonably dangerous because it did not have a “dead man” device. Although there are several types of such devices, the basic principle is the same in each type. In order to keep the lawn mower blades spinning, the operator has to remain in a certain position or has to continuously apply pressure to a pedal or handle. When the operator disengages the blades, they are quickly brought to a stop. The 1981 Snapper mowers were designed so that the blades would spin for three to five seconds after the power was turned off. Norton offered evidence that more sophisticated “dead man” devices are able to stop the blades in less than one second after the operator applies the brakes or releases the handle.</p>
<p id="c067d1d4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[After reviewing the law on product defects, the appellate court concluded that the jury could reasonably have found the mower defective. The court then considers whether a jury could reasonably have found that the defect caused Norton’s injury.]</p>

<p id="c067d1d6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Snapper correctly points out that “plaintiffs are not entitled to a verdict based on speculation and conjecture.” Fenner v. General Motors Corp., 657 F.2d 647, 651 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 942 (1982). . . . The jury is, however, permitted to “reconstruct the series of events by drawing an inference upon an inference.” Id. at 650.</p>
<p id="c067d1d7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Fenner</i>, plaintiff contended his automobile veered off the highway because of a defective steering mechanism. The steering problem would only manifest itself if a stone got caught in the steering mechanism. Because plaintiff’s vehicle was not examined by any experts and since plaintiff’s experts were only able to say that theoretically the accident could have been caused by a stone in the steering mechanism, the district court entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict for defendant. . . . </p>
<p id="c067d1d8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The causation evidence in this case, although circumstantial, was far more impressive than the evidence presented in <i>Fenner</i>. Norton testified that the lawn mower slid six feet from the top of the hill into the creek. . . . Expert testimony revealed that when Norton applied the brakes, an effective dead man device could have stopped the blades in as little as .7 seconds. The blades on the 1981 Snapper would continue to spin for three to five seconds. . . . Each of Snapper’s experts testified that, given the amount of time the mower would have taken to slide six feet and given Norton’s testimony that both of his hands were on the handle bars until the mower hit the creek, a two or three second difference in blade stopping time would have avoided the injury. . . . Snapper was given every opportunity to point out the weaknesses in Norton’s proof, but apparently was unpersuasive. . . . </p>

<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0686e24-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Start with procedural theory.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcroman">
<li class=""><p id="c0686e25-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Houchens</i> was decided on a motion for summary judgment, under Rule 56; <i>Norton</i> was decided after trial on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (now called a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law) under Rule 50. So the two motions come at different stages: The summary judgment motion usually comes at the end of discovery and always <i>before</i> trial commences. By contrast, a motion for judgment as a matter of law comes <i>during</i> or <i>after</i> trial when the evidence for one or both sides has already been presented. But both ask the same question: Is one party entitled to victory because there just isn’t any evidence to support the other side?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0686e26-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the two motions cover similar ground, why is there ever any need for judgment as a matter of law? Shouldn’t summary judgment have been granted if there really was no evidence to support one side? Logically, the answer would be that, in a perfect world, there should never be a successful motion for judgment as a matter of law—because all the cases in which one would be granted have been eliminated at the summary judgment stage. The real world is not so tidy. It often happens that what looks at the pretrial stage like an evidentiary conflict evaporates at trial: A witness fails to appear or tells a different story at trial than in the lawyer’s office. In that situation the motion for judgment as a matter of law serves as a back-up to summary judgment.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class=""><p id="c0689537-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now turn to the facts of the two cases. In <i>Houchens</i> the court affirmed a grant of summary judgment while conceding it was possible that Houchens had died accidentally. Does the jury verdict in <i>Norton</i> rest on more than a finding that the absence of a dead-man mechanism <i>might</i> have caused the accident?</p></li>

</li>
<li class=""><p id="c0689538-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What will happen to this case now? The court of appeals has “reversed” and “remanded” the trial court’s decision, which means that the entry of judgment notwithstanding the verdict is reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court. The district court should then enter judgment on the jury’s verdict.</p></li>

<p id="c068953b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus far, we have focused on the ways in which procedural rules create tactical opportunities for parties. Now, consider procedure as strategy for the judge. The trial judge in <i>Norton</i> denied a defense motion for a directed verdict: Doing so was tantamount to saying that a reasonable jury could find for the plaintiff. Then, when the jury did find for the plaintiff, the judge—looking at exactly the same evidence that was before him when he denied the directed verdict motion and applying the same legal standard—made the opposite ruling: that no reasonable jury could find for the plaintiff and judgment notwithstanding the verdict was appropriate. At the level of logic, the judge has to be wrong at least once—either when he denied the directed verdict motion or when he granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>
<p id="c068953c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Maybe there’s a deeper procedural logic at work here, a logic that emerges if one contemplates the interplay of trial and appellate courts and the costs of a second trial. When judges make rulings, they want them to be correct—at least in the sense that they will be affirmed on appeal. But a wise judge knows that not all her rulings will be affirmed, so sometimes judges take that into account. While we don’t know the thought processes of the trial judge in <i>Norton</i>, suppose he thought as follows: “I think I’m right in believing that there’s no proof of causation, but it’s a close case and an appellate court might reverse me. If I grant the directed verdict and send the jury home, and it then turns out that I’m wrong on causation, we’ll have to have a second trial—and product liability cases, with dueling expert testimony, take a good bit of time. Suppose, then, I deny the motion for a directed verdict, and let the jury decide the case. If they agree with me that there’s no causation, fine. But if they don’t—if they find for the plaintiff—I can still grant judgment notwithstanding the verdict. And, if the case is appealed and the appellate court disagrees with my ruling, we won’t have to try the case again. I’ll simply enter judgment on the original jury verdict.” Make sense?</p>

<p id="c068bc4f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most of us are vaguely familiar with the criminal law notion of double jeopardy, which prevents a person from being tried twice for the same crime. Not surprisingly, there is a similar notion in civil procedure. If Peters sues Dodge for injury to his car and loses, he should not be allowed to refile the same case, seeking damages for those same injuries, again. Lawyers speak of such questions under the general heading of former adjudication. There are actually two branches of former adjudication: claim preclusion (or, in its Latin equivalent, <i>res judicata</i> (literally, (some)thing adjudicated)) and issue preclusion (<i>collateral estoppel</i>). Claim preclusion prevents a case from being brought again (as in the <i>Peters v. Dodge</i> example). Issue preclusion prevents an issue from being revisited: If Peters sues Dodge for damage to his car and loses because the court finds the car did not actually belong to Peters, Peters would likely be bound by that finding in a future case.</p>

As might be expected, deciding what is and is not the same claim is sometimes difficult. In Chapter 11, we will consider different understandings of what constitutes the “same claim,” and see how courts have considered close cases. For now, we stick with a straightforward example.</p>

Ison contends that the trial court misapplied the rule against splitting one’s cause of action, an aspect of the doctrine of <i>res judicata.</i> We disagree and so affirm.</p>
<p id="c068e367-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ison alleges that in July 2003 Thomas injured him in an automobile accident on Kentucky Highway 9 near Foster in Pendleton County. Soon after the accident, in August 2003, Ison sued Thomas and Thomas’s insurer for losses arising from the damage to Ison’s vehicle. . . . A jury awarded him about $5,000.00 for his property losses. . . . Ison brought the present personal injury action against Thomas in April 2005. The trial court, noting the long standing rule in Kentucky that “one may not split up his cause of action and have it tried piecemeal,” Hays v. Sturgill, 302 Ky. 31, 34 (1946), ruled that Ison’s personal injury claim was part of the same cause of action as his property damage claim and so had merged with the prior judgment. We agree.</p>

<p id="c0690a7d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, Ison contends that Thomas waived the affirmative <i>res judicata</i> defense by failing to plead it in his answer to Ison’s complaint. He notes, correctly, that CR 8.03 [analogous to Federal Rule 8(c)(1)] requires affirmative defenses such as <i>res judicata</i> to be “set forth affirmatively” in the answer, that is, that the pleading should give fair notice of the particular defense and a short statement of its grounds. . . . We agree with Ison that Thomas’s Answer . . . did not satisfy a notice standard for any particular affirmative defense. Nevertheless, CR 8.03 is not to be applied mechanically, and waiver need not be found where the affirmative defense is raised by timely motion that does not prejudice the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="c0690a7e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, Thomas raised the <i>res judicata</i> defense in a motion for summary judgment in September 2005, only about five months into the case and before either party had expended much on discovery. . . . </p>
<p id="c0690a7f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, our law requires that all claims against a single defendant arising from a single negligent incident be brought in a single action. Ison improperly split his claim for property damages from his claim for personal injury damages, where both claims arose against a single defendant as a result of a single automobile accident. The damages claims should have been brought together, and because they were not, the trial court correctly ruled that the subsequent action is barred. Accordingly, we affirm the January 30, 2006 order of the Pendleton Circuit Court.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c06958aa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most observers would say that the Restatement quote more accurately reflects the trend of the law in this area because it defines precluded claims as involving those that arise from the same transaction as the original claim as opposed to the “subject of litigation.” In <i>Ison v.

<li class=""><p id="c0697fbd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note that in the other cases in this chapter, the result flowed from interpreting and applying a Rule or a statute. Not here; why? Because, unlike the other areas encountered in this chapter—and in most of the rest of this course—the principles of former adjudication have been developed by courts on a case-by-case basis rather than being set forth in statutes or Rules. Nothing in principle prevents there being such a statute, but the effort of drafting one has not recommended itself to Congress or to state legislatures. When you study the principles of former adjudication in greater detail in Chapter 11 you may better understand why legislatures have left this area to the courts.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0697fbe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Congress and legislatures may be wise to avoid legislating former adjudication, this decision makes this topic relatively unusual in your Civil Procedure course. It stands out as an island in a sea of legislation and Rule-making. A thousand years ago—even two hundred years ago—the geography of procedure looked different. For many centuries judges made most procedural law in the course of adjudication, with the occasional statute standing out as an island in a sea of common law. Two great movements of procedural reform starting in the second half of the nineteenth century gave legislatures (and later Rule-makers) the dominant position they enjoy today, leaving only a few common law islands (such as former adjudication) remaining.</p></li>

<p id="c0697fc1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our judicial system permits a losing party to appeal an adverse judgment of the trial court to a higher court. One might imagine that an appellate court can correct any errors that the trial court has made. Yet procedural rules limit in two significant respects appellate courts’ power of review.</p>
<p id="c069a6d2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="51" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-51">p. 51</span>The first limitation concerns the standard of the appellate courts’ review. Put in very simplified form, existing doctrine tells the appellate courts that they should affirm findings of fact unless “clearly erroneous.” By contrast, rulings of law should only be affirmed if the appellate court would have reached the same conclusion. But, regardless of the standard of review, the court of appeals should not reverse unless the lower court’s error affected the outcome of the lawsuit. Finally, in many areas, the law itself gives the trial judge discretion to balance competing concerns in making a ruling—for example, whether the potential information to be gained from a particular discovery request is outweighed by the financial burden of complying with that discovery request. In those areas, the issue on appeal is not whether the appellate court judges would themselves have balanced the competing interests the same way, but whether the trial court can be said to have abused its discretion.</p>
<p id="c069a6d3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second limitation concerns the timing of appellate review. Imagine that a trial judge has made an important discovery ruling, one that both parties believe will affect the outcome of the case. Further, suppose that the ruling is at least questionable and that the party on the losing end of the ruling appeals. Read 28 U.S.C. §1291, which defines the jurisdiction of the federal courts of appeals: “The courts of appeals . . . shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all <i>final</i> decisions of the district court. . . . .  . . . ” (emphasis added). That bland statement has a negative implication: that the courts of appeals do <i>not</i> have jurisdiction over an effort to appeal from an order that is not a “final decision.” Lawyers call a non-final order “interlocutory.” The next case shows “the final judgment rule,” as it is often called, applied to a discovery order under Rule 35 for a mental examination of the plaintiff.</p>

<p id="c069cde9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">E.H. Reise, who was graduated in the top 5% of his class from the Law School of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, applied for a position on its faculty. The Law School did not hire him. He believes that his race and sex account for the decision, that in recent years the Law School has been unwilling to consider anyone, no matter how skilled, who is not black, female, or otherwise eligible for preferential treatment. According to Reise, only one of the last thirteen appointments to the faculty has been a white male, and that appointment was made in 1985. The Law School says that the persons it hired are better lawyers and scholars than Reise. The district court has set a trial for this coming April to get at the truth.</p>
<p id="c069cdea-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Reise has filed an appeal] . . . asking us to reverse the judge’s order that he submit to a mental examination under Fed. R. Civ. P. 35. Reise demands $4 million in compensatory damages on account of the mental anguish, emotional distress, and illness that he says he has endured as a result of the Law School’s decision not to hire him. Not surprisingly, the Law School wants to obtain a medical opinion on Reise’s mental state, so that it may present evidence on that subject at trial. Reise insists that because he is over his distress and is not seeking damages on account of his <i>current</i> mental <span title="52" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-52">p. 52</span>condition, an examination would reveal nothing of value. Again not surprisingly, the Law School is not content with Reise’s say-so and wants to check. The district judge, siding with the Law School, ordered Reise to undergo an examination.</p>
<p id="c069cdeb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Reise contends that the examination is unnecessary and that the judge should at all events have ensured that the physician would be independent of the University, we shall have nothing to say about [those contentions]. Details of discovery are a long way from final decision [and the discovery order is therefore “interlocutory” and the Court of Appeal thus lacks jurisdiction to consider Reise’s argument, 28 U.S.C. §1291]. . . . </p>
<p id="c069cdec-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is too late in the day to waste words explaining why interlocutory orders, and discovery orders in particular, are not appealable despite their irreversible costs. Because almost all interlocutory appeals from discovery orders would end in affirmance (the district court possesses discretion, and review is deferential), the costs of delay via appeal, and the costs to the judicial system of entertaining these appeals, exceed in the aggregate the costs of the few erroneous discovery orders that might be corrected were appeals available. . . . </p>
<p id="c069cded-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Discovery orders, including orders to submit to an examination, are readily reviewable after final decision. A party aggrieved by the order assures eventual review by refusing to comply. The district judge then imposes sanctions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2). The probable sanction in a case such as this is an order striking Reise’s claim for damages on account of mental and physical distress. If Reise should prevail on the merits but not obtain damages because of the order striking his claim, he may obtain full review on appeal: if the district judge abused his discretion in requiring Reise to submit to an examination, we will remand for further proceedings. True, this procedure creates a potential for two trials, but then so does any other discovery order, or an order disqualifying or failing to disqualify counsel, or any order granting or denying partial summary judgment. . . . And requiring the complaining party to take some risk—to back up his belief with action—winnows weak claims. Only persons who have <i>substantial</i> objections to the examination and believe their legal positions strong will follow a path that could end in defeat. Among those who take the risk by balking at the order, some will lose on the merits, and their discovery disputes will become moot. Most of the remaining cases will end in affirmance, given deferential review. The number of retrials entailed by the procedure is small, the number of appeals avoided large.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c069f503-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The argument against the final judgment rule relies on a different kind of pragmatic reasoning. Most cases will not end in a judgment of any sort—the parties will settle. Judicial rulings that precede settlements are not appealable, but those rulings may have dictated the terms of the settlement by greatly advantaging one party. In those settled cases—the majority of all cases—it seems unjust to allow what may be practically dispositive judicial rulings to escape appellate review. Some states, New York most notable among them, have adopted this reasoning by providing for liberal interlocutory appeal of significant trial court rulings. Others (the federal courts included) create some statutory exceptions to the final judgment rule and weasel a bit with judge-made doctrines that slightly soften its impact. It is nevertheless still fair to say that the rule poses an insuperable barrier to immediate appeal of many trial court rulings.</p></li>

<p id="c06a4339-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this and other law school courses you will read a good many appellate opinions from state and federal courts. What determines which court will hear such an appeal?</p>
<p id="c06a433a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most basic proposition is that the appellate courts of whatever system the case starts in will hear subsequent appeals. Thus in the federal system, parties who lose a “final decision” in the district court can appeal to the court of appeals. The courts of appeals hear cases from district courts in regions covering several states, <span title="55" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-55">p. 55</span>each region being called a “circuit.” There are 11 circuits covering the 50 states, a twelfth for the District of Columbia, and a thirteenth, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals in certain specialized cases—patent actions, for example. Thus the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit hears cases from the district courts in Connecticut, Vermont, and New York; the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit hears cases from the district courts in Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Atop the courts of appeals is the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
<p id="c06a6a4b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same principle applies in the state courts. <i>Ison v. Thomas</i> was decided by the Kentucky Court of Appeals because the case was initially heard by a Kentucky trial court. Most states have an appellate structure resembling the federal system—a trial court of general jurisdiction, an intermediate appellate court to which all cases may be appealed, and a state supreme court<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D30_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10D30_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">9</a></span> that has discretion over which cases it will hear. In some states, however, there is no intermediate appellate court, so appeals go directly to the state supreme court.</p>
<p id="c06a6a4d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How and when does the U.S. Supreme Court get into the act? Cases reach the Supreme Court in two ways—from federal courts and from state courts. In both instances Supreme Court review is discretionary: The Justices pick and choose which cases they will hear. Thus, parties who lose in the highest state court or federal court of appeals must apply to the Supreme Court to have their case heard, which they do by asking the Court to grant a <i>writ of certiorari</i>. See 28 U.S.C. §§1253-1258.</p>
<p id="c06a6a4e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is an additional barrier to U.S. Supreme Court review of state court cases. The Supreme Court may hear a state court case <i>only</i> if it presents an issue of federal law. It cannot hear cases from the state supreme court that involve solely questions of state law. In other words, cases like <i>Ison</i> that exclusively concern state law—there, state law rules governing former adjudication—cannot be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. This rule does not stop people from trying to get their case heard by the Supreme Court. How might they do so? If they can “make a federal case” out of it—perhaps by arguing that Kentucky’s laws governing former adjudication violate the U.S. Constitution’s Due Process Clause. (That’s a losing argument on <i>Ison</i>’s facts, but it would be the only imaginable way of dragging federal law into the case.)</p>
<p id="c06a6a4f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, because the Court enjoys broad discretion in selecting which cases it will hear, a decision not to review a case does not signify approval of the decision rendered by the court below. So, if the U.S. Supreme Court denies petition for certiorari, that doesn’t mean it affirmed the lower court’s ruling; it just decided not to review the case.</p>

<p id="c06a6a52-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the year you will encounter repeated discussion of procedural issues in various substantive courses. Discussing a case in Contracts, your instructor may <span title="56" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-56">p. 56</span>ask about the procedure by which the case reached the appellate court; a Torts class may focus on the question of what additional evidence would have enabled a plaintiff to avoid a directed verdict for the defendant. A Property class may explore the defects in a plaintiff’s complaint for trespass that led the court to grant a motion to dismiss. These scenarios do not represent efforts by your other instructors to seize pedagogical territory by conquest. Instead they reflect the role that substantive law plays in procedural decisions and that procedure plays in substantive law.</p>
<p id="c06a6a53-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lawsuits grow from disputes. Parties may dispute what happened and what consequences the law attaches to those happenings. At several stages of litigation, procedure establishes hurdles that a party must jump. Demurrers or Rule 12(b)(6) motions are one such hurdle; motions for summary judgment, a directed verdict, or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict are others. All these procedural devices require the judge to reflect on the substantive law that applies to the case and to describe the way in which that law applies to the facts as they then appear: that makes such cases good teaching tools for the substantive law involved.</p>
<p id="c06a6a54-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Focusing on the procedural stance of the case clarifies two points. First, seeing that the case arises on an appeal from a motion to dismiss, an objection to jury instructions, or the like explains <i>why</i> the judge is engaging in a recitation of the substantive law. Second, understanding the procedural stance of the case enables you to see how much of what the court says depends purely on a legal assessment of the case and how much depends on a factual assessment. For example, on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court considers whether the plaintiff’s allegations in the complaint, if proved, would entitle him to the court’s help; it does not consider whether it is likely that the plaintiff could prove the truth of those statements. On a motion for summary judgment or a directed verdict, by contrast, the court must consider both the law that applies to the case and the evidence that the parties have gathered and presented.</p>
<p id="c06a9165-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Procedure will thus play two roles in your substantive courses. First, various procedural hurdles will provide the occasion for judicial expositions of the law of torts, property, contract, and crimes. Second, by understanding the procedural stage at which the issue under discussion arose, you will also understand the extent to which the court is considering the facts of the particular case. Comprehending this dual role will enable you to see both the way in which procedure shapes substantive law and the reason procedural discussions will often play a central role in learning that substantive law.</p>

Following the questions are analyses of each of them, together with brief explanations of why various responses are correct or incorrect. We hope both will be useful to you. But, we’d also like to make a suggestion about how to use these questions to best effect. You’ll get almost nothing out of the questions if you use them as one of your authors used <span title="57" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-57">p. 57</span>such questions in his high-school algebra text—looking quickly from the problem to the solution and then mentally telling himself, “Yes, I knew that.” Much better is to work through each question, write down your responses, and only after completing all the questions consult the analyses. Even better—counterintuitive as it may seem—is to work through the problems and then wait a day to consult the responses. Though it sounds odd, that method has a great deal of cognitive science research behind it: Apparently our minds retain things better when we space rather than bunch our learning.

B is correct because Rule 11—as well as analogous rules of professional responsibility—require the lawyer to investigate his client’s version of the facts before filing a complaint (and so it makes sense to do this investigation before deciding whether to assume the responsibilities of representation). D is correct because Peters will have to rely on diversity jurisdiction to make it into federal court and, as <i>Hawkins</i> (and a thousand other cases) teach, determining diversity involves both physical residence and objective indications of an intent to remain indefinitely. Taking steps like registering to vote and registering his motor vehicle in Michigan may help Peters make such a showing. A is wrong because such tactical decisions are for the lawyer rather than the client; even a law student like Peters is unlikely to be able to make a sensible choice about such a matter. C is wrong because the lawyer will want to verify Peters’s story before drafting any complaint.</p>

A: A pre-answer motion may be made on any of the grounds listed in Rule 12(b). B: An answer is always an appropriate response to a complaint, and the most common response in an answer is a denial of one or more key allegations of the complaint. D: One may make a pre-answer motion, but one may equally decide instead to answer and to assert as defenses matters that might have been the subject of a pre-answer motion (such as lack of subject matter jurisdiction). C is wrong: A 12(b)(6) motion assumes—for the purposes of argument—that all the allegations of the complaint are true. To dispute those allegations—including the allegation of the date of the accident—one would file an answer denying whichever allegations one wants to dispute and then marshal evidence supporting one’s claim during discovery, to be used at summary judgment.</p>
