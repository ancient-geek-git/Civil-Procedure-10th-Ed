<p id="c0a5779c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">People don’t litigate for fun. Lawsuits cost money. Worse, they are for most participants miserable experiences whether they win or lose. Why would anyone bring a lawsuit? Conversely, plaintiffs almost always seek something in defendant’s power to grant; why, instead of paying up, does defendant choose to add the insult of litigation to what may be the eventual injury of an adverse judgment? And to complete the inquiry, one should also ask whether the expense and unpleasantness of litigation are socially desirable. Should it be easier to commence or defend a lawsuit, or is it already too easy? Lawyers give two labels to these inquiries: remedies (what courts can do to and for litigants) and access to justice (whether barriers to litigation are too high or too low).</p>

<p id="c0a5779f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Trying to answer the questions above is silly without knowing a little about the existing litigation system. Whether litigation should be easier—or whether it is already too easy—should turn on facts, not supposition. Legislators, editorial writers, and scholars debate whether litigation is “out of control.” Some of this debate turns on factual premises. To participate in this debate or to be a well-informed lawyer one needs to know how much litigation there is, what it consists of, how long it takes, and what its results are.</p>
<p id="c0a577a0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="294" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-294">p. 294</span>Because of jurisdictional limits on the federal courts, about 95 percent of litigation in the United States occurs in state courts. In 2008 (the most recent year for which complete data are available), just fewer than 100 million cases were filed in those state courts.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10038_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10038_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*1</a></span> That number represents the outcome of almost two decades (1984-2000) of rising rates of civil litigation, followed by a decade of flat or declining rates, a decline sharpened by the economic downturn. Of those 100 million cases, a bit more than half involve traffic and similar ordinance violations. Some of those cases can significantly affect people’s lives—lost driving licenses, towed cars, and increased insurance premiums—but the adjudication of these claims is not typically what we think of as serious litigation.</p>
<p id="c0a577a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The remaining 48 million non–traffic ticket cases could be thought of as “serious.” They consist of two large groups—civil and criminal cases—and two specialized subsets of the large groupings: Juvenile cases are specialized criminal cases, and family law (sometimes known as domestic relations) cases are a similarly specialized form of civil litigation.</p>
<p id="c0a577a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "></p><div style="width:564px" class="epub-image-container" id="c0a59eb4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"><div class="epub-image "><img alt="A pie chart shows the non-traffic case distribution for 2012." src="./Chapter 5- Incentives to Litigate_files/9781543808094_Ch05-1.png" style="max-width:564px" aria-describedby="img-longdesc-c0a59eb4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"></div></div><p></p>
<p id="c0a59eb9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If one excludes the traffic ticket cases and combines domestic relations with general civil cases and juvenile with criminal cases, two large categories emerge, with the civil/domestic cases comprising just over half of the docket and the criminal/juvenile cases just under half.</p>
<p id="c0a59eba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This course focuses on the civil portion of that litigation. If one includes the domestic relations cases, that’s about 25 million cases; if one excludes the domestic relations cases, as most statistical studies of civil litigation do, the number is about <span title="295" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-295">p. 295</span>20 million civil lawsuits per year. As noted, over the preceding 50 years that number first grew then shrank. It shrank both absolutely (total number of cases filed) and on a per capita basis (number of cases per 100,000 population).</p>
<p id="c0a59ebb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why this growth followed by this decline? Experts disagree, but a consensus seems to be forming that civil litigation tracks economic activity. Christian Wollschlager, Exploring Global Landscapes of Litigation Rates (Nomos: 1998) (indicating high litigation rates in developed economies, with Germany, Sweden, Israel, and Austria having higher per capita rates of litigation than the United States). All other things being equal, economic growth produces more civil litigation. Conversely, economic recessions, such as the one the United States has recently passed through, lead to declining rates of civil litigation.</p>
<p id="c0a59ebc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Focusing on the civil lawsuits, one can ask what these 20 million civil disputes were about. Data on this fairly basic question is not definitive, but recent samples suggest the predominance of contract claims. One seven-state sample found the following categories:</p>
<p id="c0a59ebd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "></p><div style="width:564px" class="epub-image-container" id="c0a59ebe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"><div class="epub-image "><img alt="A pie chart shows the different categories of civil disputes." src="./Chapter 5- Incentives to Litigate_files/9781543808094_Ch05-2.png" style="max-width:564px" aria-describedby="img-longdesc-c0a59ebe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"></div></div><p></p>
<p id="c0a5c5d7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similar surveys confirm the dominance of contract cases. The leading nonpartisan agency collecting state court statistics summarized: “High-value tort and commercial contract disputes are the predominant focus of contemporary debates, but collectively they comprised only a small proportion. . . . of the caseload. In contrast nearly two thirds were contract cases and more than half of these were debt collection and landlord/tenant cases.” If one reflects on the widespread use of contract as the principal technique for ordering U.S. economic life (including the widespread use of credit), dominance of contract claims makes sense.</p>
<p id="c0a5c5d8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At first glance, you might think a litigator trying to predict the fate of her case, or a public official allocating judicial budgets, would care more about how many cases there are than what they are about. But, like some first impressions, this one turns out to be wrong. No sort of case goes to trial at a high rate: The national <span title="296" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-296">p. 296</span>average hovers around 4 percent, with about 90 percent of those trials coming before a judge rather than a jury.</p>
<p id="c0a5c5d9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If all cases went to trial at the same rate, one would expect that most trials would be in contract cases. Not so: Torts, though far less than half of the filings, comprise 60 percent of the trials. In large part this mismatch occurs because so many “contract” cases are essentially debt collection actions, in which there is no real dispute about facts or law. Many of these actions will end not in a trial but in a default judgment.</p>
<p id="c0a5c5da-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When trial does occur, the tort/contract distinction also affects the kind of trial: When contract cases do go to trial, most are tried to a judge (called a “bench” trial), while 90 percent of the tort cases that reach trial go before a jury. Because bench trials are a bit easier to schedule and usually a little faster than jury trials, the mean time to judgment in a contract case is between 9 and 10 months; torts take the longest, about 16 months. Actual trials, when they occur, are short: The mean jury trial lasts less than four days, bench trials two days. As with all averages, these conceal wide variations; two New Jersey cases were reported to have been pending for decades!</p>
<p id="c0a5c5db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Who wins? Again, the answer differs depending on whether it is a tort or contract case. In tort trials plaintiffs win (that is, get a judgment for some amount above $0) just about half the time (51 percent of jury cases, 56 percent of bench trials). Plaintiffs do better in contract trials, prevailing in just over two-thirds of the cases. Bear in mind that that “winning” can be a relative term: A plaintiff who recovers a judgment for $10,000 has prevailed in court, but may not feel much like celebrating if he turned down an offer to settle for $15,000 before incurring the expense of trial. When plaintiffs win, how much do they recover? News accounts suggest fabulous sums; reality is different. In data collected before the 2009-2016 “Great Recession,” the median recovery in tort cases was between $21,000 and $24,000 (bench and jury verdicts, respectively). In contract cases, the median plaintiff’s judgment was $75,000 in jury verdicts and $25,000 in bench-tried cases (suggesting that perhaps parties choose to try the smaller cases to judges). In fewer than 10 percent of all cases won by plaintiffs does the judgment reach $1 million: 8.3 percent of contract cases tried to a jury, 5.7 percent of tort cases similarly tried. In an analogous data set compiled during the recession (2012-2013), the amounts were somewhat different: a median tort recovery (recall we are talking only about successful plaintiffs) of $64,761; for contracts $9,428. Because the two data sets differed one cannot say with any certainty whether they represent changing trends or sample differences.</p>
<p id="c0a5c5dc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One fact stands out starkly in the 2012-2013 data: In many cases, the cost of competent representation (lawyer’s fees and experts) “likely outstrips the monetary value of the case.” If that conclusion is not an artifact of the recession, it presents a serious challenge to the legal profession and to the legal system, about which we’ll have more to say when we turn, later in this chapter, to litigation finance.</p>
<p id="c0a5c5dd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Seen from a different perspective, these numbers mean that the average stakes in civil litigation lie within $25,000 of the median family income for a year. These are hardly trivial amounts, but neither are they the stuff of urban legend and professional folktales. If there is a serious concern, it would be about litigants who cannot afford competent representation. Still another way to view matters is from <span title="297" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-297">p. 297</span>the perspective of the lawyers who operate the system on behalf of their clients. A plaintiffs’ lawyer, even a competent and successful one, could have a career in which she never recovered a million-dollar verdict. On the other hand, a lawyer representing defendants will spend a good deal of his time trying to make sure that his client does not end up on the wrong side of the less-than-10-percent of cases in which there is a seven-figure verdict.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0a6140d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For those who think that the decline in trials presents a problem, locating solutions is not easy. Some suggest increased funding for judicial positions and courtrooms, arguing that adjudication plays a critical but underappreciated role in society and the economy. Others look to modern legal culture, which has, they argue, created “litigators” who run the pretrial process but consciously avoid trial—in part because they have had little experience with trial work—and are abetted by judges who themselves may be uneasy with the rapid-fire evidentiary rulings required by trial.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6140e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Be clear about what trial rates do and do not mean. Although most civil cases will not end in trial, many will end with a judicial decision. Some cases end almost as soon as they begin, with a default judgment: About 14 percent of the total cases and about a quarter of contract cases end with default judgments, probably because a defendant has no defense to a claim for an unpaid debt. For others, the end will come with a pretrial ruling—about jurisdiction, about the sufficiency of pleadings, about discovery issues, or at summary judgment—even though there is no trial. For example, in the federal system, for which we have elaborate statistics, such rulings are dispositive (that is, case-ending) in about one-third of all filings. So a low trial rate does not mean a low adjudication rate. As you will see, a good part of the contemporary litigation process is the pretrial process.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6140f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those cases that do not end in trial or a pretrial ruling end in events that are more ambiguous: settlement (often reflected in voluntary dismissal) or abandonment (followed by involuntary dismissal for failure to prosecute).</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0a61410-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These terminations may represent a response to the merits: As facts are uncovered, the plaintiff recognizes that what he thought was a strong case has a fatal flaw and gives up rather than throwing good money after bad. Defendant, recognizing that there is only a small chance of a giant plaintiff’s verdict, nevertheless decides not to take that chance and settles to eliminate the risk of a catastrophic judgment. These decisions, though they don’t result in an official resolution of the dispute, represent the litigants’ responses to the merits of the case.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a61411-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, either outcome may represent surrender to financial exigency: A plaintiff gives up a strong case because she cannot afford to litigate any further; a defendant offers something to make a plaintiff with a trumped-up claim go away because winning on the merits will cost more than the <span title="299" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-299">p. 299</span>settlement offered.

<p id="c0a61414-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The people filing the 20 million civil lawsuits each year want something; the people against whom the lawsuits are filed want to know what they stand to lose. To a lawyer, those questions translate into inquiries about what remedies a court will order—what acts it will require of the defendant if the plaintiff prevails.</p>
<p id="c0a61415-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Take a very common and very simple lawsuit. D fails to pay her credit card debt. P wants to collect the debt. To get the state’s help in collecting the debt, the legal system requires P to file suit, describing the claim and asking for a remedy. If P prevails, he gets a judgment, a statement by the court that P is legally entitled to a certain sum of money. P can then use that judgment to get access to various post-judgment remedies to collect that money from any assets that D has. These may include getting an employer to garnish D’s wages, an order attaching D’s checking or savings accounts, or putting a lien on any real property D owns, so the property cannot be sold without paying P. The exact scope and procedures for using these post-judgment remedies lie beyond the scope of this course. For now, you need to understand that a judgment is the key that unlocks these remedies.</p>
<p id="c0a61416-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Remedies embodied in judgments aim to cure a legal harm. Remedies can be divided into two groups—those that seek to provide the plaintiff with a reasonable substitute for whatever was lost (substitutionary remedies) and those that seek to restore directly and specifically that which the defendant has taken from the plaintiff (specific remedies). If, for example, defendant takes plaintiff’s car unlawfully, a specific remedy would be an order (either to the defendant or the sheriff) commanding the return of the car. A substitutionary remedy would be a judgment that defendant pay plaintiff enough money to buy an equivalent car. One issue we will examine is the extent to which plaintiffs can choose between specific and substitutionary remedies.</p>
<p id="c0a63b27-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To create the conditions for a lawsuit, plaintiff must want something that defendant is unwilling to give her. Sorting roughly, there are three such things: money; an enforceable order to do (or not to do) something; or a declaration of the parties’ respective rights. We’ll consider those three remedies, as lawyers call them, in order. We will then consider preliminary relief; remedies ordered before the merits of the case have been adjudicated.</p>
<div id="c0a63b28-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0a63b29-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">1.&nbsp;Damages</p></h3></div>

<p id="c0a63b2a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By far the most common remedy awarded by U.S. courts are judgments for money damages. This frequency of money damages has several causes. One is that in a credit economy many claims are for debts, and a successful debt claim will always <span title="300" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-300">p. 300</span>result in a damage judgment. Second, for many common claims specific remedies are impossible: Defendant cannot replace an injured limb or erase the pain of disfigurement or defamation. Money may be a poor substitute, but only a substitute is possible. Because damages are a substitute, however, sometimes the law encounters difficulty in deciding how to measure them. In settlement negotiations the parties bargain directly about how much (or how little) they would accept to dispose of the case. In trials, judges and juries must resort to less direct methods for estimating the value of a substitute. Many of these methods depend on the existence of a market in which the substitute can be priced, but some substitutionary remedies involve damages for which there is no market.</p>
<p id="c0a63b2b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even when there is a market, and even when the defendant is clearly liable, the law requires a plaintiff to prove the amount of damages. Sometimes that’s easy: The damages for an unpaid promissory note are the principal sum plus accrued interest. Sometimes that’s far more difficult: How much is a lifetime of impaired mobility or pain worth? The law insists that judges and juries decide, without a great deal of guidance. The next case displays a judge wrestling with these questions in an unusual context.</p>
<p id="c0a63b2c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you have seen (or will see) in Chapter 3, under some conditions a defendant can “remove” a case from state to federal court—if there would have been subject matter jurisdiction in federal court. And, as you may already know, there is federal subject matter jurisdiction over cases involving parties from different states when the amount in controversy is more than $75,000. The next case shows the defendant trying to remove—and encountering from plaintiff the argument that damages are insufficient to permit a federal court to hear the case.</p>

<p id="c0a66144-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present action arises from Plaintiff Zelma Troupe’s slip and fall on premises owned and operated by Defendant C &amp; S Wholesale Grocers and was originally filed in the State Court of Bibb County, Georgia. In the Complaint filed in the State Court, Plaintiff asserts that she suffered “severe physical injuries” and “excruciating and severe physical distress” as a result of Defendant’s negligent inspection and maintenance of its premises. She seeks damages for medical expenses in an amount <span title="301" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-301">p. 301</span>"in excess of $13,637.00” and prays for an additional award of “all damages allowed under Georgia Law including, but not limited to, recovery for special and general damages, including pain and suffering, both mental and physical, in the amount to be proven at the time of trial.” Plaintiff further seeks to recover punitive damages, the cost of litigation, and “such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.” Upon review of the Complaint, Defendant filed a timely Answer and Notice of Removal of the action to this Court. Plaintiff then filed the present motion seeking remand and an award of payment of just costs, actual expenses, and attorney fees incurred.</p>

<p id="c0a66146-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Any action initially brought in state court may be removed if “the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction.” Title 28 U.S.C. §1441(a). “One category of civil actions with such original jurisdiction is those between ’citizens of different states’ where the amount in controversy ’exceeds the sum or value of $75,000.’” At issue in this case is whether the amount in controversy exceeds that required for this Court to exercise federal subject matter jurisdiction under Title 28 U.S.C. §1332(a)(1).</p>
<p id="c0a66147-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The burden of proving any jurisdictional fact rests upon the party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts. . . . Generally, when a complaint does not claim a specific amount of damages, “removal from state court is proper if it is facially apparent from the complaint that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional requirement.” In the event that the jurisdictional amount is not facially apparent on the complaint, “the court should look to the notice of removal and may require evidence relevant to the amount in controversy at the time the case was removed.”</p>
<p id="c0a66148-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jurisdictional amount may be apparent on the face of the Complaint if the language clearly alleges extensive damages such as long-term medical expenses, mental and physical pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of wages and earning capacity, and permanent disability and disfigurement or other serious injuries. Here, however, the amount in controversy is not so apparent. Simply put, there is no way to determine from the Complaint whether Plaintiff has been so badly injured as to make an award of over $75,000 more likely than not. Plaintiff’s Complaint merely asserts that she suffered “severe physical injuries” and “excruciating and severe physical distress” as a result of Defendant’s negligence, specifies damages for medical expenses “in excess of $13,637.00,” and prays an award of “other special and general damages, including pain and suffering, both mental and physical, in the amount to be proven at the time of trial.” There [is] simply nothing on the face of the Complaint to suggest that she will seek recovery for long-term medical expenses, permanent disability and disfigurement, or loss of wages or diminished earning capacity.</p>
<p id="c0a66149-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant’s Notice of Removal provides more assistance, however. The Notice and attached copies of Plaintiff’s medical records include additional information about the extent of Plaintiff’s injuries: describing the amount of lower back and leg pain Plaintiff endures, detailing her efforts at pain management (including undergoing physical therapy, chiropractic manipulation, and spinal blocks), and showing that her pain continues even a year after the alleged incident. The Court may in fact consider this type of evidence.</p>
<p id="c0a6614a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="302" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-302">p. 302</span>According to the medical records, Plaintiff claims to have fallen on her left hip and back while in the Defendant’s store and that this incident is believed to have aggravated a pre-existing back injury. The records further indicate that Plaintiff complained of severe, unrelenting pain (sometimes categorized as an 8, 9, or 10 on a 10 point scale) which could not be controlled with medication, that such pain persisted even more than a year after her fall, and that she is possibly still incurring medical expenses for pain management. The records also indicate that Plaintiff lives alone, is self-employed, and owns her own house cleaning service. She has stated that her pain is exacerbated by lifting, bending, stooping, prolonged standing—all of which were required in her profession as a house cleaner. Plaintiff in fact told her physicians that she was forced to reduce the number of houses that she could clean because of her back condition and that she had to discontinue personal activities such as exercising, which also aggravated her pain. Such assertions, if proven, suggest that, if she prevails, Plaintiff will likely be able to recover unspecified damages for long term medical expenses, loss of wages and earning capacity, mental and physical pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life in addition to Plaintiff’s specified claim for medical expenses in excess of $13,637.00 and claim for punitive damages.</p>
<p id="c0a6614b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given this additional information, the Court concludes that Defendant has satisfied its burden of establishing that the special, general, and punitive damages in this case, if proven, will “more likely than not” exceed the minimum jurisdictional amount. Plaintiff’s Motion to Remand is accordingly DENIED.</p>

<div class="epub-heading  left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0a6af7e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">a.&nbsp;<i>Damage Amounts: Ceilings and Floors</i></p></div>
<p id="c0a6af7f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because so much civil litigation is about money, any legal rule that limits or increases the amount of damages that can be awarded on a given claim will likely decrease or increase the number of lawsuits brought to vindicate those claims. Some examples illustrate this proposition. In the course of the twentieth century, courts and legislatures expanded the circumstances in which punitive damages were available. The concept behind punitive damages is that they punish defendants for particularly reprehensible behavior—including behavior that does not produce substantial compensatory damages. Punitive damages are generally available for intentional torts—or for behavior falling short of intentionality that is deemed outrageous. That could include behavior ranging from a punch thrown in a fistfight to knowingly selling toxic food products. The potential availability of punitive damages creates a powerful weapon for plaintiffs (and, defendants argue, an unfair advantage). Their power arises because punitives (as they are known in the trade) make the badness of the behavior rather than the damage to plaintiffs the measure of liability, and “badness” is a subjective judgment. And, though punitive <span title="304" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-304">p. 304</span>damages are awarded in fewer than 10 percent of civil cases where plaintiffs prevail, in some cases involving large institutional defendants, damage awards have been large indeed.</p>
<p id="c0a6af80-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Statutory damages similarly strengthen plaintiffs’ claims. These are minimum damage awards decreed by legislation, often in situations in which compensatory damages will be small or difficult to prove. For example, the Copyright Act gives holders whose rights have been infringed a choice between proving lost profits and accepting statutory damages in an amount between $500 and $20,000 for a negligent violation and up to $100,000 for a willful violation. 17 U.S.C. §504(c); Feltner v. Columbia Pictures Television, Inc., 523 U.S. 340 (1998) (holding that a jury must set the amount of statutory damages between the applicable minimum and maximum). Minimum damage provisions (often coupled with separate provisions for attorneys’ fees) also arise in the context of small transactions (bad-check statutes provide a common example); they are designed to offset the costs of litigation over matters that are often small in dollar amount and to encourage plaintiffs to enforce public policy by bringing suit.</p>
<p id="c0a6af81-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If punitive and statutory damages have the effect of encouraging litigants to sue in cases where they are available, limiting damages has the opposite effect. In recent decades, some states have sought to curb medical malpractice litigation by putting caps on “noneconomic” damages in such cases. E.g., Cal. Civ. Code §3333.2(b) (capping medical malpractice noneconomic damages at $250,000). Such limitations will, all other things being equal, reduce the number of filings in areas where these limitations apply.</p>
<p id="c0a6af82-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other damage caps result from judicial decisions. Responding to defendants’ arguments that punitive damages were out of control, the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003 ruled that an award of punitive damages more than nine times the compensatory damages in a case will presumptively violate the Due Process Clause. See State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408 (2003). Thus, if in <i>Troupe</i> plaintiff was awarded punitive damages, they would likely be limited to nine times her compensatory damages (medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering). And all jurisdictions prohibit punitive damages on contract claims.</p>
<p id="c0a6af83-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, consider damages that are, in advance of any lawsuit, negotiated between the parties. Given the difficulty of calculating compensatory damages, in some situations the parties try to agree beforehand about the price of the harm. The most common such situations are contractual, in which the parties may agree to liquidated damages for breach of contract. Their power to so agree is limited in several ways. They may not agree to liquidated damages unless the actual damages would be difficult to calculate. The parties could not, for example, agree to liquidated damages of $1,000 for failure to repay a $500 debt. An example of a statute simultaneously permitting and limiting liquidated damages is Uniform Commercial Code §2-718(1):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0a6af84-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable in light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.</p>

<p id="c0a6af87-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Troupe</i> also illustrates another aspect of how lawyers think about damages—dividing them into categories. The opinion twice distinguishes between “special” and “general” damages; lawyers also speak of “hard” and “soft” damages and of “economic” and “noneconomic” damages. Several of these categories overlap.</p>
<p id="c0a6af88-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Start with special, economic, hard damages. The case discusses the medical expenses Troupe has already incurred: $13,637.00. Lawyers sometimes call such damages, as to which one can name a precise figure, as “hard” or “special” damages. In <i>Troupe</i>, other special damages would include lost income from her housekeeping business: She would presumably have records showing how much she had earned in a typical week and how many weeks she had been out of work. Lawyers would also categorize these as “economic” damages: A damage award would serve to compensate her for specific dollar losses—medical expenses and lost earnings.</p>
<p id="c0a6af89-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By contrast, consider Troupe’s claim for pain and suffering. Troupe will not be able to present a receipt for these, but the law treats them as real, compensable injuries. Like pain and suffering, emotional distress may be an element of damages in some cases. So may, in appropriate cases, loss of consortium (harm to a relationship), humiliation, and harm to reputation. These are all examples of general, noneconomic, “soft” damages.</p>
<p id="c0a6af8a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">U.S. law uses damages to compensate for these noneconomic harms as well.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10278_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10278_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*2</a></span> As you might expect, proving and measuring noneconomic damages presents a challenge. Experienced lawyers and insurance adjusters often use rules of thumb in settling such cases: three times the amount of economic damages for pain and suffering is one common guideline. But these guidelines are not part of law, so juries cannot be instructed to use them. Instead, the parties must offer proof of noneconomic damages. A litigation technique popular among attorneys required to offer such “proof” in physical pain and suffering cases is to ask the jury how much it would take to compensate the plaintiff for a single hour’s (or day’s) suffering, and then to multiply that number by the expected duration of the pain—sometimes a lifetime. In Beagle v. Vasold, 65 Cal. 2d 166, 417 P.2d 673, 53 Cal. Rptr. 129 (1966), a trial court was reversed for abuse of discretion because it had refused to permit such an argument. Such efforts are in part a result of jury instructions that do not give many guidelines. Following are model jury instructions that offer little guidance to the fact-finder:</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0a6d6a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a breach of contract case, plaintiff asks the court to instruct the jury to award as much damages as it will take to “send the defendant a message” about breaking its promise; what ruling on the request?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6d6a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff’s estate and plaintiff’s survivors seek to recover damages for the wrongful death of a retired elderly grandparent. There are no lost earnings, and the principal elements of damages will be for the relationships between the deceased and his surviving children and grandchildren. If you represent the plaintiffs, you will want to show a jury the value of the relationships ended by the death—with family pictures, testimony about the frequency of visits to the grandparent, the effect of the grandparent’s death on the children’s emotional well-being. Whom would you want to testify about what? If you represent the defendant, how, concretely, would you seek to minimize damages—maybe with evidence showing that the children continued to thrive in school and had large networks of family and friends?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6d6a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometimes the need for proof of damages serves not as a barrier but as an aid to recovery. In a claim for personal injuries, the badly injured plaintiff seeks to introduce evidence of her cries of pain during physical therapy; defendant objects that such evidence will prejudice the jury. What is plaintiff’s best response?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0a6d6a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issues sketched above represent a sample of problems in measuring compensatory damages.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0a6d6a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometimes the damage in question has no market. In ascertaining such damages courts do not simply ask the plaintiffs how much it would take to compensate them for the harm they have suffered. One reason for not doing so is the parties’ understandable temptation to exaggerate the amount.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6fdb7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At other times there is a market, but plaintiff has no access to it. For example, contract doctrines require that the plaintiff mitigate damages by trying to find a substitute for defendant’s breach, even if plaintiff has to borrow money to buy the substitute. But what if plaintiff doesn’t have good credit? See Valencia v. Shell Oil Co., 23 Cal. 2d 840, 845, 147 P.2d 558, 560 (1944) (plaintiff unable to borrow funds necessary to mitigate damage caused by defendant): “The duty to minimize damages does not require an injured person to do what is unreasonable or impracticable, and, consequently, when expenditures are necessary for minimization of damages, the duty does not run to a person who is financially unable to make such expenditures.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6fdb8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="307" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-307">p. 307</span>A third problem arises from the law’s efforts to individualize damages. Such insistence reflects the goal of what might be called the “perfect remedy"—that which provides an exact compensation for the harm suffered by this plaintiff. The goal is noble, but it has its costs, chiefly in the time it takes to establish the precise level of harm. If lawyers and insurance companies regularly use multipliers as rules of thumb, and if predictability is the goal, would statutory schedules (e.g., three times economic damages as pain and suffering in personal injury cases) be a better approach?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6fdb9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts insisting on such individualization do not mention the cost of vindicating the legal right to compensation—court fees, attorneys’ fees, and the like. The reason for this omission is simple: As you will see in Section C of this chapter, American courts do not typically compensate successful litigants for the cost of litigation. This feature of remedial law means that an award of compensatory damages, no matter how precisely calculated, will always fall short of full compensation if plaintiff has to pay her lawyer.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6fdba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you have seen in the preceding section, lawsuits take time. Time costs money. Courts take account of delay by adding interest to the damages; in cases involving large sums and long delays, the amount of interest and the date at which it starts to accrue will matter. Those rules vary substantially across jurisdictions, making it hard to lay down generally applicable principles. Rules for awarding interest vary depending on whether it is calculated from the time the claim accrues (prejudgment interest) or only during the time between the entry of judgment and the moment when the judgment amount is paid (post-judgment interest).</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0a6fdbb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In most jurisdictions, the nature of the harm sued for will determine whether prejudgment interest accrues. The Restatement (Second) of Torts §913 provides for prejudgment interest for the taking of property and for other pecuniary harms if necessary to avoid injustice, but not for bodily injury, emotional distress, or reputational harms. What theory underlies such a distinction? The Restatement (Second) of Contracts §354 provides for prejudgment interest on actions brought to enforce a sum certain (for example, a promissory note), and for interest on other contracts “if justice requires.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6fdbc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After judgment is entered, most jurisdictions provide for interest to accrue until the judgment is paid, but the rate of interest varies considerably. Federal law (28 U.S.C. §1961) ties such post-judgment interest to the rate of one-year U.S. Treasury Bills. Some states, however, have fixed rates, which may be above or below the prevailing rate (for example, 10 percent in California. Civ. Proc. Code §685.010 (Matthew Bender 2010)).</p></li>

<p id="c0a6fdbf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though damages are the most commonly sought remedy, they are not the only available one. Courts may order parties to do things or to refrain from doing them; they also can enlist the help of officials in recapturing personal or real property <span title="308" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-308">p. 308</span>from defendants wrongfully possessing or occupying it. Lawyers refer to these remedies as specific remedies. Take an agreement for the purchase of a house. If the market drops and the buyers get cold feet, the sellers can sue for the difference between the agreed-on price and the new (lower) market price—a substitutionary remedy. If the market rises and it is the sellers who back away from the agreement, the buyers now have a choice of remedies. They might sue for damages measured by the difference between the contract price and the market price of an identical house—a substitutionary remedy. But another remedy would also be available—an order from the court commanding the sellers, under penalty of contempt, to convey the property. Such a “decree for specific performance” is one among an array of available specific remedies.</p>
<p id="c0a6fdc0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose the sellers sign the deed conveying their house, but then refuse to vacate for the new buyers. Under those circumstances the buyers could seek to eject the sellers, getting a court order that required the sheriff to remove them from the premises. Or, suppose when the sellers left, they mistakenly left behind some jewelry. Under those circumstances the sellers could replevy the jewels: A successful action of replevin results in a court order requiring a sheriff to return an item to its owner.</p>
<p id="c0a6fdc1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to these specialized remedies, courts have broad power to enter injunctions (court orders directed to parties) commanding them to do or stop doing an act. Some of these orders can be narrow and specific: stop dumping waste on plaintiff’s property. Others can be complex and subtle: establish a system of outpatient psychiatric assistance that meets the needs of patients currently institutionalized. In the twentieth century many of the most interesting and controversial remedies were specific: for example, racial integration of schools and places of employment; and changes in the operation of prisons, hospitals, and other institutions.</p>
<p id="c0a6fdc2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The power to issue injunctions—as opposed to other forms of specific relief—derives from the jurisdiction exercised by the courts of equity in England and later in the colonies. Since at least the sixteenth century, courts have withheld equitable relief—refusing to grant injunctions and other equitable remedies—unless the plaintiff could demonstrate that the forms of relief offered by the common law were “inadequate.” The next case displays a court considering whether and why a legal remedy—damages, in this instance—was inadequate.</p>

<p id="c0a724d8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff’s prima facie case tends to show the following facts: that defendant Ellen S. Geoghegan has been a patient for a considerable length of time at Sibley <span title="309" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-309">p. 309</span>Memorial Hospital, which is maintained and operated by the plaintiff corporation. The hospital is a private hospital. Evidence has been further introduced tending to show that the hospital came to the conclusion that the patient no longer needs hospital care but can be adequately provided for at a nursing home.</p>
<p id="c0a724d9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After a series of negotiations on June 2nd, 1967 the president of the hospital corporation made a formal demand on the defendant Thomas Geoghegan, the husband of the other defendant, that Ellen Geoghegan, his wife, be transferred from Sibley Memorial Hospital. This demand is worded as follows: “I again request you to make arrangements for the transfer of your wife, Ellen Geoghegan, from Sibley Memorial Hospital.” The mere fact that the polite word “request” is used does not detract from the tenor of the letter as a demand.</p>
<p id="c0a724da-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What, then, is the status of the defendant Ellen Geoghegan when her departure from the hospital has been demanded by the hospital? Manifestly she becomes a trespasser. This action is brought for an injunction to require her removal from the hospital as a trespasser. Obviously an action for damages would be an inadequate remedy.</p>
<p id="c0a724db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A private hospital has a right to accept or decline any patient. It has a moral duty to reserve its accommodations for persons who actually need medical and hospital care and it would be a deviation from its purposes to act as a nursing home for aged persons who do not need constant medical care but who need nursing care. There are homes for the aged, there are nursing homes and similar institutions. Hospitals have a duty not to permit their facilities to be diverted to the uses for which hospitals are not intended.</p>
<p id="c0a724dc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The correspondence introduced in evidence shows that the male defendant takes the position that his wife should remain in the hospital for the remainder of her life. For the hospital to permit that would be to allow a diversion of its facilities to purposes for which they are not intended and would not be in the public interest. An action for damages, of course, would present no solution so far as the plaintiff is concerned because the husband is able and willing to pay whatever the hospital would charge.</p>
<p id="c0a724dd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has been established for a great many years that equity will enjoin a continuing trespass or a series of repeated trespasses where an action for damages would not be an adequate remedy. There is a leading English case on that point, London &amp; Northwestern Railway Co. v. Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway Co., Law Reports 4 Equity Cases 174, 179. The Supreme Court has approved and enforced this doctrine on many occasions. . . . This Court had occasion to consider this matter in Potomac Electric Power Co. v. Washington Chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, 210 F. Supp. 418, 419, and stated, “It is well established that equity may enjoin continuing trespasses, repeated or irreparable injuries to property, or a course of illegitimate interference with business activities, if a remedy by an action for damages is not adequate. This is one of the traditional functions of equity.”</p>
<p id="c0a724de-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear that in this case the damages in an action at law would obviously be inadequate, as has already been stated.</p>
<p id="c0a724df-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of these considerations the defendants’ motion to dismiss is denied.</p>

<p id="c0a74bf6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Historically, the power to issue injunctions was lodged not in the courts of common law, but in the Court of Chancery, which administered substantive law and remedies called “equitable.” The judge in Chancery was the Lord Chancellor, who was both a judge and a high political official: Imagine that the President’s Chief of Staff also ran a judicial system. Because a central function of equity was to solve problems created by the rigidities of common law, and because the Chancellor was, by virtue of his position, sensitive to broader political and social implications of his decisions, equity jurisprudence, as it was called, often took account of factors that a court of common law would not. For example, it often looked to see whether someone seeking an equitable remedy had himself behaved properly—had, as the doctrine put it, “clean hands.” It also took explicitly into account the public interest—something you see in <i>Geoghegan</i>. And, to a greater extent than common law, it gave substantial discretion to the Chancellor in shaping its rulings. Though equitable remedies in U.S. courts are no longer ordered by gentlemen wearing large wigs, substantive law and the remedies administered still have much of the texture created by centuries of English equity practice.</p>

<p id="c0a77315-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Occasionally, a party has a legal problem that neither damages nor a specific remedy can solve. Imagine, for example, that Alice, whose signature appears on a promissory note due in five years, denies the note’s validity. How is Sam, holding the note, to determine whether he has a valuable asset or a worthless piece of paper? He cannot sue for damages until the note is due, and there is no claim for injunctive relief on the facts stated. Meanwhile, witnesses’ recollections are fading and Sam, who wants to raise money for a small business, cannot with certainty list the note as an asset. Or suppose Entrepreneur has a potentially important (and profitable) invention he wants to bring to market, but his potential investors are frightened by those in competing industries who contend that his device will infringe their patents. Entrepreneur has as yet suffered no harm and cannot get an injunction or damages—but he wants a court to declare that his invention does not infringe existing patents—allowing him to reassure his would-be investors. Or imagine a theater owner wants to show a film declared obscene by the local prosecutor, who has threatened to prosecute anyone who exhibits the film. Thinking that the film is not obscene, the owner wishes to show it. He wants to abide by the law, however, and doesn’t want to risk a jail sentence as the price of guessing wrong about the law of obscenity.</p>
<p id="c0a77316-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once upon a time, Sam, Entrepreneur, and Theater Owner would have been able to rely only on “counsel’s opinion” about the legality of their proposed course of action. Under the federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§2201 and <span title="312" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-312">p. 312</span>2202, and similar statutes in almost every state, parties in such circumstances may now seek from a court a declaration of their rights without seeking or being in a position to seek any coercive relief such as damages or an injunction. The procedure for declaratory judgment in the federal courts is governed by Rule 57. Unlike equitable relief, which is available only in the absence of adequate legal remedies, declaratory relief may be chosen by a party even though other remedies are open to her. See Rule 57. In fact, one can see the declaratory judgment statute as designed in part to overcome this limitation.</p>

<p id="c0a79a33-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Congress passed the federal Declaratory Judgment Act in 1911, the statute has created several knotty problems for the federal courts. Most of these problems lie beyond the boundaries of an introductory course in civil procedure, but brief mention will help connect this topic to other parts of this course and other courses:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="c0a79a34-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One concerns the line between a hypo­thetical case and a concrete factual controversy. Article III of the Constitution limits federal courts’ jurisdiction to “cases and. . . . controversies.” Trivially, that means a law student cannot dream up a hypothetical and ask a federal court to resolve it. Because in many declaratory judgment actions no present coercive relief is available, some claims look too much like hypothetical questions—and thus lie outside the boundaries of Article III. In this introductory course we won’t probe the line between appropriate and inappropriate actions for declaratory relief.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0a79a35-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Declaratory relief can also raise juris­dictional problems, some of which flow from the interaction of the well-pleaded complaint rule (exemplified in <i>Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. v. Mottley</i>, supra page 210) and the requirements of federal question jurisdiction. The premise of the well-pleaded complaint rule is that courts look at the allegations in a plaintiff’s complaint to determine whether federal subject matter jurisdiction exists. Declaratory judgment actions, however, tend to be brought by potential defendants against those that would sue them (and so are seeking a declaration of their rights regarding the contested issue). How should courts, instructed to follow the well-pleaded complaint rule, view the complaint in a declaratory judgment action that raises a federal question? The courts have said that a party who would assert a federal defense in an action for coercive relief cannot create federal jurisdiction by asserting that defense as a claim for declaratory relief. That means the Mottleys could not have pleaded their way into federal court simply by asking for declaratory relief (even if the statute had existed at the time they brought their case). But the courts have also suggested that if either party could state a claim for coercive relief that would arise under federal jurisdiction, then an action for a declaratory judgment will also “arise under” federal law; it is safe to say that not much more is clear, and that when you study federal jurisdiction in an advanced course you will better understand how vexing the question is.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0a79a36-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other issues might arise about the interaction between declaratory relief and diversity jurisdiction. Imagine that Insurer, from Texas, sues Joe, from California, in federal court, seeking a declaration that Joe’s $100,000 life insurance policy is invalid because he fraudulently misrepresented his medical record in applying for the <span title="314" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-314">p. 314</span>insurance. Joe challenges diversity jurisdiction, on the grounds that Insurer’s complaint does not satisfy the amount in controversy requirement because he seeks no monetary damages. The fact that Insurer does not seek monetary damages does not necessarily mean he cannot sue in federal court. Instead, the court will look to see the value of the declaratory relief. In this case, the value of the declaratory relief would be tied to the amount of insurance that would have to be paid at Joe’s death if the policy were valid.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0a79a37-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What about other issues? If P sues D for breach of contract, P bears the burden of producing evidence and the burden of persuasion. But if D sues P for a declaration that D has not violated the contract in question, who should bear these burdens? The case law is again muddled on the subject. And if D sues P for a declaration that D has not breached a contract on which P might have sued either for damages or for specific performance, is either entitled to a jury trial? See Chapter 9.</p></li>

Newspaper files an action in federal court for declaratory relief, seeking a declaration that its statements are protected by the First Amendment. What result? Unlike the action for declaratory relief brought by Arthur against Barbara, there is no case or controversy here because there is no actual dispute between the newspaper and the mayor’s office. Note, however, that some state courts have more permissive approaches to declaratory judgments—perhaps Newspaper should file in state court instead.</p></li>

<p id="c0a7c14f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A remedy that comes too late is useless—worse than useless if the client has incurred costs to obtain it. In state and federal courts currently the median time to trial (for those cases that do go to trial) is a bit more than 18 months. Litigants cannot always wait. Interest added to money judgments is one recognition of the importance of delay. But life sometimes demands speed. The battered spouse needs a protective order immediately, not after a year’s wait for trial. The small business threatened by a competitor’s unlawful action will be bankrupted if it has to wait for trial. Provisional remedies—relief pending final adjudication of the dispute—respond to this need.</p>
<p id="c0a7c150-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although provisional remedies solve some problems, they create others: Because they must be granted or denied before the case has been heard on the merits, the judge (all temporary relief will be granted by a judge, not a jury) must base her decision on incomplete information and act without the full adversarial exchange that would accompany a trial. This section considers two problems: How should a court decide when to grant temporary relief in the face of incomplete information? And when does the curtailment of ordinary procedures that is necessary to grant temporary relief amount to a denial of due process?</p>
<p id="c0a7c151-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before addressing these issues notice a spectrum of provisionality created by the Rules and analogous state practices. A final injunction—like that sought in <i>Lucy Webb Hayes Natl. Training School v. Geoghegan</i> (page 308)—occurs after a full trial, with all the procedure that entails. But what if time itself will make the eventual remedy meaningless because the threatened harm will already have occurred? In principle, the answer is an order that holds things in place while the court decides whether final relief is appropriate. See Rule 65. Such orders come in three versions with successively smaller procedural protections—and correspondingly greater speed. The preliminary injunction one might think of as “trial lite”: It occurs after evidentiary presentations and argument—but with perhaps curtailed discovery and less than complete evidence. Faster—and more temporary—is the temporary restraining order; as the phrase implies, it lasts for a limited time—usually just long enough to have a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction. The most dramatic form of the temporary restraining order is the ex parte T.R.O.—ex parte meaning that the order is issued without notice to the opposing party or opportunity for that party to present evidence or argument. Why would a court issue such an order—and why wouldn’t it violate the most basic concepts of due process? A careful reading of Rule 65(b) suggests a reason: Suppose that the very act of notifying the opposing party will cause the threatened harm? Perhaps the defendant will spirit the money that might satisfy a damage judgment out of the reach of the court, or retaliate against the spouse or partner seeking the order. In such cases courts <span title="316" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-316">p. 316</span>issue very short-term orders: Rule 65(b) says no longer than 14 days with a provision for a hearing on two days’ notice if sought by the party subject to the order.</p>

<p id="c0a7c154-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Getting from the opening pleading to final relief takes time, and preliminary injunctions (and their siblings, temporary restraining orders) exist to deal with harms that arise from that inevitable delay. But such preliminary relief comes with a built-in problem. First, a court entering such an order necessarily knows less than it would after full evidentiary presentation (that’s why it’s preliminary). Second, sometimes entering such a temporary order can help the plaintiff only by harming the defendant. The Supreme Court faced such a situation in the next case; did it resolve it correctly? And are the principles it establishes for similar cases the right ones? As you consider these questions, note that, though the case cites various federal statutes, the Court is debating standards that either a state or a federal court might apply in any case seeking a preliminary injunction.</p>

Richardson comp. 1897). So said George Washington in his first Annual Address to Congress, 218 years ago. One of the most important ways the Navy prepares for war is through integrated training exercises at sea. These exercises include training in the use of modern sonar to detect and track enemy submarines, something the Navy has done for the past 40 years. The plaintiffs complained that the Navy’s sonar training program harmed marine mammals, and that the Navy should have prepared an environmental impact statement before commencing its latest round of training exercises. The Court of Appeals upheld a preliminary injunction imposing restrictions on the Navy’s sonar training, even though that court acknowledged that “the record contains no evidence that marine mammals have been harmed” by the Navy’s exercises.</p>

The parties strongly dispute the extent to which the Navy’s training activities will harm those animals or disrupt their behavioral patterns. The Navy emphasizes that it has used MFA sonar during training exercises in SOCAL for 40 years, without a single documented sonar-related injury to any marine mammal. The Navy asserts that, at most, MFA sonar may cause temporary hearing loss or brief disruptions of marine mammals’ behavioral patterns.</p>
<p id="c0a7e871-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs are the Natural Resources Defense Council, Jean-Michael Cousteau (an environmental enthusiast and filmmaker), and several other groups devoted to the protection of marine mammals and ocean habitats. They contend that MFA sonar can cause much more serious injuries to marine mammals than the Navy acknowledges, including permanent hearing loss, decompression sickness, and major behavioral disruptions. According to the plaintiffs, several mass strandings of marine mammals (outside of SOCAL) have been “associated” with the use of active sonar. They argue that certain species of marine mammals—such as beaked whales—are uniquely susceptible to injury from active sonar; these injuries would not necessarily be detected by the Navy, given that beaked whales are “very deep divers” that spend little time at the surface.</p>

<p id="c0a7e873-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The procedural history of this case is rather complicated. The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA), 86 Stat. 1027, generally prohibits any individual from “taking” a marine mammal, defined as harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing it. 16 U.S.C. §§1362(13), 1372(a). The Secretary of Defense may “exempt any action or category of actions” from the MMPA if such actions are “necessary for national defense.” §1371(f)(1). In January 2007, the Deputy Secretary of Defense—acting for the Secretary—granted the Navy a 2-year exemption from the MMPA for the training exercises at issue in this case. The exemption was conditioned on the Navy adopting several mitigation procedures. . . . </p>
<p id="c0a7e874-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 83 Stat. 852, requires federal agencies “to the fullest extent possible” to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for “every. . . . major Federal actio[n] significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.” 42 U.S.C. §4332(2)(C) (2000 ed.). An agency is not required to prepare a full EIS if it determines—based on a shorter environmental assessment (EA)—that the proposed action will not have a significant impact on the environment. 40 CFR §§1508.9(a), 1508.13 (2007).</p>
<p id="c0a7e875-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In February 2007, the Navy issued an EA concluding that the 14 SOCAL training exercises scheduled through January 2009 would not have a significant impact on the environment. . . . </p>
<p id="c0a7e876-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shortly after the Navy released its EA, the plaintiffs sued the Navy, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that the Navy’s SOCAL training exercises violated NEPA, the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), and the Coastal Zone <span title="318" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-318">p. 318</span>Management Act of 1972 (CZMA). The District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and prohibited the Navy from using MFA sonar during its remaining training exercises. The court held that plaintiffs had “demonstrated a probability of success” on their claims under NEPA and the CZMA. The court also determined that equitable relief was appropriate because, under Ninth Circuit precedent, plaintiffs had established at least a “’possibility’” of irreparable harm to the environment. Based on scientific studies, declarations from experts, and other evidence in the record, the District Court concluded that there was in fact a “near certainty” of irreparable injury to the environment, and that this injury outweighed any possible harm to the Navy.</p>

<p id="c0a7e878-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals further determined that plaintiffs had carried their burden of establishing a “possibility” of irreparable injury. Even under the Navy’s own figures, the court concluded, the training exercises would cause 564 physical injuries to marine mammals, as well as 170,000 disturbances of marine mammals’ behavior. Lastly, the Court of Appeals held that the balance of hardships and consideration of the public interest weighed in favor of the plaintiffs. The court emphasized that the negative impact on the Navy’s training exercises was “speculative,” since the Navy has never before operated under the procedures required by the District Court. In particular, the court determined that: (1) the 2,200-yard shutdown zone imposed by the District Court was unlikely to affect the Navy’s operations, because the Navy often shuts down its MFA sonar systems during the course of training exercises; and (2) the power-down requirement during [certain] conditions was not unreasonable because such conditions are rare, and the Navy has previously certified strike groups that had not trained under such conditions. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the District Court’s preliminary injunction struck a proper balance between the competing interests at stake.</p>

On the facts of this case, the Navy contends that plaintiffs’ alleged injuries are too speculative to give rise to irreparable injury, given that ever since the Navy’s training program began 40 years ago, there has been no documented case of sonar-related injury to marine mammals in SOCAL. . . . For their part, plaintiffs assert that they would prevail under any formulation of the irreparable injury standard, because the District Court found that they had established a “near certainty” of irreparable harm.</p>
<p id="c0a80f90-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the Navy that the Ninth Circuit’s “possibility” standard is too lenient. Our frequently reiterated standard requires plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief to demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction. Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983). Issuing a preliminary injunction based only on a possibility of irreparable harm is inconsistent with our characterization of injunctive relief as an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.</p>
<p id="c0a80f91-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not clear that articulating the incorrect standard affected the Ninth Circuit’s analysis of irreparable harm. Although the court referred to the “possibility” standard, and cited Circuit precedent along the same lines, it affirmed the District Court’s conclusion that plaintiffs had established a “’near certainty’” of irreparable harm. . . . </p>
<p id="c0a80f92-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As explained in the next section, even if plaintiffs have shown irreparable injury from the Navy’s training exercises, any such injury is outweighed by the public interest and the Navy’s interest in effective, realistic training of its sailors. A proper consideration of these factors alone requires denial of the requested injunctive relief. For the same reason, we do not address the lower courts’ holding that plaintiffs have also established a likelihood of success on the merits.</p>

<p id="c0a80f94-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right. In each case, courts “must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.” Amoco Production Co., 480 U.S., at 542. “In exercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should pay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.” Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S., at 312. In this case, the District Court and the Ninth Circuit significantly understated the burden the preliminary injunction would impose on the Navy’s ability to conduct realistic training exercises, and the injunction’s consequent adverse impact on the public interest in national defense. . . . </p>
<p id="c0a80f95-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case involves “complex, subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training, equipping, and control of a military force,” which are “essentially professional military judgments.” We “give great deference to the professional judgment of military authorities concerning the relative importance of a particular military interest.” As the Court emphasized just last Term, “neither the Members of this <span title="320" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-320">p. 320</span>Court nor most federal judges begin the day with briefings that may describe new and serious threats to our Nation and its people.” Boumediene v.

<p id="c0a80f96-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the record contains declarations from some of the Navy’s most senior officers, all of whom underscored the threat posed by enemy submarines and the need for extensive sonar training to counter this threat. . . . </p>

<p id="c0a80f98-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These interests must be weighed against the possible harm to the ecological, scientific, and recreational interests that are legitimately before this Court. . . . </p>
<p id="c0a80f99-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While we do not question the seriousness of these interests, we conclude that the balance of equities and consideration of the overall public interest in this case tip strongly in favor of the Navy. For the plaintiffs, the most serious possible injury would be harm to an unknown number of the marine mammals that they study and observe. In contrast, forcing the Navy to deploy an inadequately trained antisubmarine force jeopardizes the safety of the fleet. Active sonar is the only reliable technology for detecting and tracking enemy diesel-electric submarines, and the President—the Commander in Chief—has determined that training with active sonar is “essential to national security.”</p>
<p id="c0a836aa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The public interest in conducting training exercises with active sonar under realistic conditions plainly outweighs the interests advanced by the plaintiffs. Of course, military interests do not always trump other considerations, and we have not held that they do. In this case, however, the proper determination of where the public interest lies does not strike us as a close question. . . . </p>

<p id="c0a836b5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Flexibility is a hallmark of equity jurisdiction. “The essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power of the Chancellor to do equity and to mould each decree to the necessities of the particular case. Flexibility rather than rigidity has distinguished it.” Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 312 (1982) (quoting Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329 (1944)). Consistent with equity’s character, courts do not insist that litigants uniformly show a particular, predetermined quantum of probable success or injury before awarding equitable relief. Instead, courts have evaluated claims for equitable relief on a “sliding scale,” sometimes awarding relief based on a lower likelihood of harm when the likelihood of success is very high. 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §2948.3, p. 195 (2d ed. 1995). This Court has never rejected that formulation, and I do not believe it does so today. . . . </p>

<li class=""><p id="c0a85dcb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That problem, in different guises, is the problem of the preliminary injunction: Sometimes one can’t help A without harming B just as irreparably as A says it will be harmed if the order is not entered.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a85dcc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The harm can be of many different kinds. For example, in many business transactions, market conditions will mean that even a short delay makes the transaction financially infeasible. Raider Corporation wants to buy Sluggish Co. for several million dollars. The management of Sluggish seeks a preliminary injunction, alleging that the acquisition will violate securities laws and mean the loss of scores of jobs if Raider tries to cut expenses. Raider opposes the injunction, contending that Sluggish’s management is only trying to protect their ill-deserved salaries, and arguing that even a three-week delay (until a fuller hearing can occur) will mean the expiration of their financing for the acquisition. Given the standards for a preliminary injunction articulated in <i>Winter</i> how would you, sitting as the district court judge, rule on such a motion?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a85dcd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">John Leubsdorf described the “dilemma” of the preliminary injunction as follows:</p>

<p id="c0a85dce-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If [the court] does not grant prompt relief, the plaintiff may suffer a loss of his lawful rights that no later remedy can restore.

The dilemma, of course, exists only because the court’s interlocutory assessment of the parties’ underlying rights is fallible in the sense that it may be different from the decision that ultimately will be reached. The danger of incorrect preliminary assessment is the key to the analysis of interlocutory relief. . . . The court need not consider every harm resulting from an erroneous preliminary decision, but only harm that final relief cannot address.</p>

</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a85dd1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One difficulty arises because often the court—lacking the full development of a record that trial will bring—isn’t sure who will finally prevail. What should the judge do then? There are several schools of thought:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0a884e2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority opinion succinctly states one approach: “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a884e3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Ginsburg’s dissenting opinion succinctly states a slightly different approach: “Consistent with equity’s character, courts do not insist that litigants uniformly show a particular, predetermined quantum of probable success or injury before awarding equitable relief. Instead, courts have evaluated claims for equitable relief on a ’sliding scale,’ sometimes awarding relief based on a lower likelihood of harm when the likelihood of success is very high.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a884e4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some lower court opinions express a variation of Justice Ginsburg’s sliding scale: “One moving for a preliminary injunction assumes the burden of demonstrating either a combination of probable success and the possibility of irreparable injury or that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in his favor.” Charlie’s Girls, Inc. v. Revlon, Inc., 483 F.2d 953 (2d Cir. 1973) (emphasis added).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a884e5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Does the majority opinion definitively choose one of these approaches? If one construes the holding narrowly, no: The outcome of the case turns on the majority’s understanding of the public interest on the facts of the case, rather than the other elements of the standard. After discussing what sounds like the sliding scale standard in disapproving terms ("We agree with the Navy that the Ninth Circuit’s ’possibility’ standard is too lenient"), the majority opinion then gives two reasons why it need not—and perhaps cannot—base its holding on this aspect of the case:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcroman">
<li class=""><p id="c0a884e6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the majority notes, the Ninth Circuit’s decision did not turn on that standard, since the District Court had found “that plaintiffs had established a ’near certainty’ of irreparable harm.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a884e7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Instead the Supreme Court could rest its holding on a view of the public interest that sharply diverged from that of the Ninth Circuit—assigning <span title="323" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-323">p. 323</span>more weight to the military’s view of the importance of the sonar exercise for national defense.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a884e8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Focus now on this latter public interest factor, and recall <i>Lucy Webb Hayes Natl. Training School v. Geoghegan</i> (supra page 308), which also spoke of the public interest—there of having hospitals devote their care only to patients who need medical attention. Recall that in awarding damages for breach of contract or for negligently inflicted injuries, courts do not debate whether such damages would be in the public interest. Why here?</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0a884e9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At one level the answer is fairly simple: For torts and contracts we have concluded, often over centuries, that society functions better if we award damages in such settings, so we don’t need to debate the issue anew in each case. By contrast, cases seeking injunctive relief often involve, as do <i>Winter</i> and <i>Geoghegan</i>, unusual or unique facts—as to which we haven’t worked out the public interest.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a884ea-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a very few categories of injunctive relief cases we’ve worked that out as well. As you’ll learn in Property, courts will almost always order specific performance (a special kind of injunctive relief) for a contract to sell real estate. In cases so ordering one won’t find much discussion about the public interest: The court simply decides that if there was a contract the seller will be ordered to convey title.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a884eb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At another level, the concern about the public interest flows from the equitable tradition (described above at page 310).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a884ec-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How did <i>Winter</i> get to the U.S. Supreme Court when there was no final judgment? Though appeals in the federal courts generally lie only from final judgments of the district courts (28 U.S.C. §1291), §1292(a)(1) creates an important exception to the final judgment rule, allowing interlocutory appeals from orders “granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.” Preliminary injunctions are “injunctions” for purposes of the statute. Do the circumstances of <i>Winter</i> explain why Congress permitted immediate appeals?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a884ed-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Preliminary injunctions are a provisional form of injunctive relief. There are also processes that are in effect provisional monetary relief—attachment and garnishment. The first involves seizure of property (in the case of real property the “seizure” may be accomplished by anything from physical occupation of the land to the symbolic posting of a notice at whatever office keeps track of titles to land). Garnishment involves asking some third party—often the defendant’s bank or employer—not to pay defendant money due him because the plaintiff has a claim on it. The justification for these provisional remedies resembles that for the preliminary injunctions: Without them the plaintiff may suffer severe hardship, in some cases extreme enough to render a final remedy meaningless. A plaintiff seeking damages may believe that the defendant will, if given enough time, either dissipate or conceal the assets from which a judgment could be satisfied. Under such circumstances, the plaintiff needs relief before a final judgment. That relief comes, however, at a price to the defendant. As with preliminary injunctive relief, these remedies can work great hardship <span title="324" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-324">p. 324</span>on the defendant and give significant power to the plaintiff who obtains such an order. Not only does the attachment or garnishment guarantee the plaintiff that there will be some assets from which a judgment may be satisfied, but it may also provide significant leverage in settlement discussions.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a8abfe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice who the plaintiff is in <i>Winter</i>: an affinity group, discussed in the litigation finance section of this chapter, whose members pay dues to help finance its activities, including its litigation activities. In this case, the NRDC was also probably relying on a fee-shifting statute—the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. §2412, which grants attorneys’ fees in successful actions brought against the United States.</p></li>

<p id="c0a8ac01-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Preliminary injunctions exist because final remedies can be too slow. Is it possible for provisional remedies to be too fast?</p>
<p id="c0a8ac02-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In some situations, the very procedural steps required to obtain a preliminary injunction will cause or exacerbate the threatened harm. For example, a defendant served with notice of an application for an order garnishing her bank account may transfer the money abroad or flee the jurisdiction to avoid service of process. A defendant accused of battering a spouse might inflict new harm if served with a notice of hearing on a preliminary injunction. But the absence of notice collides with another principle: the guarantee of due process. The next case illustrates the collision; it is important in its own right and as a reminder that all procedures are subject to examination under the Due Process Clause. The procedure under scrutiny, replevin, was a common law action more than 800 years old when its modern use was challenged. Historically, replevin arose because feudal landlords, if they thought their tenants were not paying rents and other obligations when due, would, without judicial authorization, seize the tenants’ goods, often livestock. The tenants, in turn, would replevy the cattle, by getting an order telling the sheriff to return them until a court had sorted out who owed whom what. Although historically replevin thus represented a debtor’s remedy (retrieving the seized cattle from the landlord), in more recent times it has come to be used by creditors—as it is in the next case.</p>

<p id="c0a8ac0a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . Margarita Fuentes,. . . . a resident of Florida[,]. . . . purchased a gas stove and service policy from the Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. (Firestone) under a conditional sales contract calling for monthly payments over a period of time. A few months later, she purchased a stereophonic phonograph from the same company under the same sort of contract. The total cost of the stove and stereo was about $500, plus an additional financing charge of over $100. Under the contracts, Firestone retained title to the merchandise, but Mrs. Fuentes was entitled to possession unless and until she should default on her installment payments.</p>
<p id="c0a8d31b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For more than a year, Mrs. Fuentes made her installment payments. But then, with only about $200 remaining to be paid, a dispute developed between her and Firestone over the servicing of the stove. Firestone instituted an action in a small-claims court for repossession of both the stove and the stereo, claiming that Mrs. Fuentes had refused to make her remaining payments. Simultaneously with the filing of that action and before Mrs. Fuentes had even received a summons to answer its complaint, Firestone obtained a writ of replevin ordering a sheriff to seize the disputed goods at once.</p>
<p id="c0a8d31c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In conformance with Florida procedure, Firestone had only to fill in the blanks on the appropriate form documents and submit them to the clerk of the small-claims court. The clerk signed and stamped the documents and issued a writ of replevin. Later the same day, a local deputy sheriff and an agent of Firestone went to Mrs. Fuentes’ home and seized the stove and stereo. . . . </p>
<p id="c0a8d31d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mrs. Fuentes instituted the present action in a federal district court, challenging the constitutionality of the Florida prejudgment replevin procedures under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. She sought declaratory and injunctive relief against continued enforcement of the procedural provisions of the state statute that authorize prejudgment replevin.</p>

<p id="c0a8d320-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the Florida statute challenged here, “[a]ny person whose goods or chattels are wrongfully detained by any other person. . . . may have a writ of replevin to recover them.  . . . ” Fla. Stat. Ann. §78.01 (Supp. 1972-1973). There is no requirement that the applicant make a convincing showing before the seizure that the goods are, in fact, “wrongfully detained.” Rather, Florida law automatically relies on the bare assertion of the party seeking the writ that he is entitled to one and allows a court clerk to issue the writ summarily. It requires only that the applicant file a complaint, initiating a <span title="326" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-326">p. 326</span>court action for repossession and reciting in conclusory fashion that he is “lawfully entitled to the possession” of the property, and that he file a security bond in at least double the value of the property to be replevied conditioned that plaintiff will prosecute his action to effect and without delay and that if defendant recovers judgment against him in the action, he will return the property, if return thereof is adjudged, and will pay defendant all sums of money recovered against plaintiff by defendant in the action. Fla. Stat. Ann. §78.07 (Supp. 1972-1973).</p>
<p id="c0a8d321-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the sole basis of the complaint and bond, a writ is issued “command[ing] the officer to whom it may be directed to replevy the goods and chattels in possession of defendant. . . . and to summon the defendant to answer the complaint.” If the goods are “in any dwelling house or other building or enclosure,” the officer is required to demand their delivery; but if they are not delivered, “he shall cause such house, building or enclosure to be broken open and shall make replevin according to the writ. . . . ” Thus, at the same moment that the defendant receives the complaint seeking repossession of property through court action, the property is seized from him. He is provided no prior notice and allowed no opportunity whatever to challenge the issuance of the writ. After the property has been seized, he will eventually have an opportunity for a hearing, as the defendant in the trial of the court action for repossession, which the plaintiff is required to pursue. And he is also not wholly without recourse in the meantime. For under the Florida statute, the officer who seizes the property must keep it for three days, and during that period the defendant may reclaim possession of the property by posting his own security bond in double its value. But if he does not post such a bond, the property is transferred to the party who sought the writ, pending a final judgment in the underlying action for repossession. . . . </p>

<p id="c0a8d323-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For more than a century the central meaning of procedural due process has been clear: “Parties whose rights are to be affected are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right they must first be notified.” It is equally fundamental that the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard “must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0a8d324-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the right to notice and a hearing is to serve its full purpose,. . . . it must be granted at a time when the deprivation can still be prevented. At a later hearing, an individual’s possessions can be returned to him if they were unfairly or mistakenly taken in the first place. Damages may even be awarded to him for the wrongful deprivation. But no later hearing and no damage award can undo the fact that the arbitrary taking that was subject to the right of procedural due process has already occurred. “This Court has not. . . . embraced the general proposition that a wrong may be done if it can be undone.” This is no new principle of constitutional law. . . . Although the Court has held that due process tolerates variances in the form of a hearing “appropriate to the nature of the case,” <i>Mullane v. Central Hanover Tr. Co</i>., and “depending upon the importance of the interests involved and the nature of the subsequent proceedings [if any],” <i>Boddie v. Connecticut</i>, the Court has traditionally insisted that, whatever its form, opportunity for that hearing must be provided before the deprivation at issue takes effect. “That the hearing required by due process is subject to waiver, and is not fixed in form does not affect its root requirement that an individual be <span title="327" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-327">p. 327</span>given an opportunity for a hearing before he is deprived of any significant property interest, except for extraordinary situations where some valid governmental interest is at stake that justifies postponing the hearing until after the event.” The Florida and Pennsylvania prejudgment replevin statutes fly in the face of this principle. To be sure, the requirements that a party seeking a writ must first post a bond, allege conclusorily that he is entitled to specific goods, and open himself to possible liability in damages if he is wrong, serve to deter wholly unfounded applications for a writ. But those requirements are hardly a substitute for a prior hearing, for they test no more than the strength of the applicant’s own belief in his rights.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106CC_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N106CC_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">13</a></span>  . . . </p>
<p id="c0a8fa36-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The minimal deterrent effect of a bond requirement is, in a practical sense, no substitute for an informed evaluation by a neutral official. More specifically, as a matter of constitutional principle, it is no replacement for the right to a prior hearing that is the only truly effective safeguard against arbitrary deprivation of property. While the existence of these other, less effective, safeguards may be among the considerations that affect the form of hearing demanded by due process, they are far from enough by themselves to obviate the right to a prior hearing of some kind. . . . </p>

First, in each case, the seizure has been directly necessary to secure an important governmental or general public interest. Second, there has been a special need for very prompt action. Third, the State has kept strict control over its monopoly of legitimate force: the person initiating the seizure has been a government official responsible for determining, under the standards of a narrowly drawn statute, that it was necessary and justified in the particular instance. Thus, the Court has allowed summary seizure of property to collect the internal revenue of the United States, to meet the needs of a national war effort, to protect against the economic disaster of a bank failure, and to protect the public from misbranded drugs and contaminated food.</p>
<p id="c0a8fa3d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Florida and Pennsylvania prejudgment replevin statutes serve no such important governmental or general public interest.

<p id="c0a8fa3e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor do the broadly drawn Florida and Pennsylvania statutes limit the summary seizure of goods to special situations demanding prompt action. There may be cases in which a creditor could make a showing of immediate danger that a debtor will destroy or conceal disputed goods. But the statutes before us are not “narrowly drawn to meet any such unusual condition.” And no such unusual situation is presented by the facts of these cases.</p>
<p id="c0a8fa3f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statutes, moreover, abdicate effective state control over state power. Private parties, serving their own private advantage, may unilaterally invoke state power to replevy goods from another. No state official participates in the decision to seek a writ; no state official reviews the basis for the claim to repossession; and no state official evaluates the need for immediate seizure. There is not even a requirement that the plaintiff provide any information to the court on these matters. The State acts largely in the dark. . . . </p>

Since the hearing may occur almost immediately following the misconduct, it follows that as a general rule notice and hearing should precede removal of the student from school. We agree with the District Court, however, that there are recurring situations in which prior notice and hearing cannot be insisted upon. Students whose presence poses a continuing danger to persons or property or an ongoing threat of disrupting the academic process may be immediately removed from school. In such cases, the necessary notice and rudimentary hearing should follow as soon as practicable, as the District Court indicated.</p>

<p id="c0a995a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Aside from what courts can do for—or to—them, clients are interested in how much it will cost them to get—or defend against—that relief. Costs of litigation affect clients and lawyers from the very start. The costs of litigation also influence questions about remedies, explored in the prior section of this chapter. Were you to eavesdrop on a conversation between a lawyer and a prospective client, you might be surprised to learn that one of the first things the lawyer wants to know focuses on the remedy sought: What damages are at stake, what injunctive or other relief is sought? The attorney may be trying to understand his client’s interests, but will also be thinking about the feasibility of bringing the case. A system that depends on parties to bear the costs of developing the case requires lawyers to think about the amount at stake in relation to the costs of litigating the case. A case that will require thousands of dollars in expert witnesses and hundreds of hours of lawyers’ time—but where only $2,000 is at stake—is not viable unless the prevailing party will recover its attorneys’ fees from the loser, something that generally happens only when a contract or a statute specifically requires that the loser pay. Similarly, a case in which defendant has a likely meritorious defense that will cost more than the damages claimed is one the lawyer will advise defendant to settle quickly. Conversely, other cases will be inexpensive to bring or defend, even if the amounts at stake are very large.</p>
<p id="c0a995a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is possible (and, we think, illuminating) to think about litigation as an investment. The plaintiff, in bringing his case, is seeking something of value. This could <span title="333" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-333">p. 333</span>be money in the form of damages. But even in cases seeking entirely equitable relief or a declaratory judgment, the plaintiff is seeking some outcome that is, at a minimum, valuable to him or to a group of similarly situated persons: smaller class sizes in the public schools, increased medical services to low-income patients, cleaner air for the region, or similar outcomes.</p>
<p id="c0a995a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff who decides to litigate in order to gain something of value must invest his money (and time) in that litigation. This investment decision is actually a series of decisions, as the parties decide whether to begin and then to continue to pursue the case. To understand this investment perspective one must understand two subsidiary points: where the money comes from; and how lawyers and their clients decide whether to continue investing in the suit. We start with the former.</p>
<p id="c0a9bcb5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some costs—the courtroom, the judge, clerical staff, and bailiffs—are borne by society generally, paid for by taxes. This public subsidy is not trivial; in 1993 one state estimated that each “judge-day” of civil litigation cost about $4,000, which is about $6,500 in 2019 dollars. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1775(f) (West 2011).</p>
<p id="c0a9bcb6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other expenses are paid by the parties. Some take the form of fees paid directly either to a court or to nonlawyers who perform some service (e.g., expert witnesses, private investigators, court reporters). But attorneys’ fees account for much of the cost of litigation in the United States; those fees are often substantial. Relatively high legal fees result in part from the design of the U.S. legal system, which assigns to parties (and their lawyers) responsibility for conducting the suit: Virtually every step of the lawsuit occurs because the lawyer on one side or the other takes some initiative. In other countries a judge or similar official paid by the state assumes some of these responsibilities; that design results in lower legal fees but higher taxes and less party control of litigation strategy.</p>
<p id="c0a9bcb7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Legal fees shape contemporary litigation. Any fee system in which the parties bear any costs of litigation will cause cases to be brought, abandoned, or settled on bases other than their legal and factual merits. Financing systems will affect not only how many suits are brought but also which ones; for example, the availability of punitive or statutory damages in a particular case category, combined with contingent fees, will, all other things being equal, move legal resources toward such cases. Conversely, limitations on damage awards will move resources away from such cases. Understanding civil litigation therefore requires comprehending the incentives and barriers to litigation posed by the way in which lawyers are paid. In thinking about fee systems, consider three sorts of incentives: those for the client (when will a prospective litigant be encouraged or discouraged?); those for the lawyer (how will the fee system affect the lawyer’s work on the case once it is under way?); and those for the opposing party, who will have their own financing mechanisms and know or can make educated guesses about the financing mechanisms of their adversaries (how will those guesses about financing affect opposition strategy?).</p>

<p id="c0a9e3ce-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Who pays for lawyers’ work? Essentially, there are five candidates: the client, the opposing party, third-party financers, society generally (via subsidies or charity), and the lawyer herself (because she does the work for free). Each accounts for a portion of U.S. civil litigation.</p>
<p id="c0a9e3cf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The system in which each party pays its own legal fees has come to be known as the American Rule. Under the English Rule (which prevails not only in England but in most of the legal systems of the developed world), the losing party pays both its own fees and those of the other side. In practice, these distinctions are less than absolute: To an increasing extent someone other than the client pays U.S. legal fees, and in Great Britain less than the full amount of actual fees is generally taxed to the other side. Thus these two “rules” do not accurately describe present practice in either country; they serve, however, as useful models and a starting point from which to explore the subject.</p>
<p id="c0a9e3d0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The English Rule in its pure form fully compensates a winning plaintiff: She gets both the damages (or other remedy) and the costs of litigation. By contrast, under the pure American Rule, a winning plaintiff has to subtract from any damages recovered the amount charged by his lawyer, and is to that extent made less than whole. Defenders of the American Rule point out that it permits litigants, typically plaintiffs, with tenable but less-than-certain cases to invoke the legal system without fear of having to bear the expense of both their own and the <span title="335" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-335">p. 335</span>opposition’s attorney. That incentive may be particularly important in a political system in which the courts play a significant role (as they do not in Britain) in protecting the constitutional rights of unpopular groups. One might not wish to burden an unsuccessful effort to protect a constitutional right with the legal fees of the victor.</p>

<p id="c0aa0aec-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Let us begin to explore the structure of fee arrangements under the American Rule with a common situation—the client who agrees to pay the lawyer’s fee. Often, but not always, agreements take the form of a written contract between lawyer and client, sometimes called a “retainer letter” (from the still-regular practice of requiring a deposit—a retainer—from a client). In some states such written agreements are required in some categories of cases. One common form of agreement calls for the client to pay the lawyer at a specified hourly rate for legal services, plus various costs—photocopying, telephone calls, and the like.</p>
<p id="c0aa0aed-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The hourly fee is probably the most common financing mechanism for U.S. litigation. Most contract and commercial litigation, which, as you may recall, accounts for the majority of civil filings, is financed this way. One study done in 2000 found that the median hourly rate for legal fees was about $110 per hour; this average masks very wide variations, with senior lawyers in large urban practices charging over $1,000 per hour and rural solo practitioners charging as little as $75 per hour.</p>
<p id="c0aa0aee-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Flat rates mean a lawyer charges a set amount for a particular matter: an uncontested divorce, a will, and so on. Some lawyers use flat rates alone or in combination with other kinds of compensation. Flat rates have the obvious advantage of a predictable, guaranteed fee. Their disadvantages are equally clear. Underestimates are possible: What begins as an uncomplicated conveyance can turn into a nightmare of legal research or title searches, forcing the lawyers to choose between malpractice and very expensive—and uncompensated—work. Yet if the lawyer tries to allow for such contingencies, she risks charging more than the matter warrants or the market will bear. As a consequence, flat rates are most often used for kinds of work that the lawyer thinks will have predictable investments of time: Wills are probably the most common example. Conversely, many lawyers have <span title="336" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-336">p. 336</span>traditionally resisted handling contested litigation on a flat-rate basis. The last decade, however, has seen erosions of this resistance, and some practice groups that do high volumes of work for a single client have entered into per-case agreements or, sometimes, annual flat rates for all litigation, relying on the law of averages to smooth things out.</p>

<p id="c0aa3209-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus far, the discussion has assumed that the client will pay legal fees directly out of current assets. Often, however, that will not be the case. Consider an everyday occurrence—an automobile accident like that described in Chapter 1, in which Peters sues Dodge for injuries and property damage. In that common type of litigation in the United States it is unlikely that either side will pay its own legal expenses directly. Both Peters and Dodge will probably have their fees paid through schemes that spread the costs among other similarly situated persons. And recent years have seen an extension of this concept into third-party litigation finance, in which “investors” in a lawsuit will assume major responsibility for its funding.</p>

Because insurers are paying legal fees for the defense, they want at a minimum to settle cases when legal fees will be more than the proffered settlement. One category of insurance policy where the insured has the right to veto a settlement is, in some states, medical malpractice, where the physician’s license may depend on the ability to vindicate her medical judgment in court. Not surprisingly, such medical malpractice insurance policies are more expensive than many other forms of liability policy.</p></li>

Plaintiff offers to settle for $50,000; the defendant’s insurer declines, litigates on the merits, and loses a $500,000 verdict. In many states, the insured might have an action for “bad faith” refusal to settle the claim within policy limits. If the insured wins such an action, the insurer is liable for the full amount of the verdict and, perhaps, for punitive damages as well. Under such circumstances, one can find insurers settling claims where liability may be questionable, or, sometimes, defending such claims after agreeing in advance to pay any verdict above the policy limit. Suppose you represent a plaintiff in a case where damages will exceed policy limits but the insurer—contesting liability—won’t settle. How might you use the threat of bad faith liability to your client’s advantage in settlement negotiations?</p></li>

<p id="c0aa803b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs’ lawyers will generally be pleased to learn that a defendant has insurance that might cover the damages sought. But complications can arise. Most common forms of liability insurance (auto, homeowners’, tenants’) cover damages for negligently inflicted injuries—only. Suppose two co-workers, Sally and Ted, are involved in an auto accident in their employer’s parking garage. Ted sustains a broken leg, which is expected to heal without lasting effects, and, because of his employer’s sick leave, he will not suffer lost wages. Thus far Ted’s lawyer will be happy to learn that Sally has auto liability insurance, but he will also understand that in these circumstances compensatory damages are unlikely to be large. Further suppose, however, that Sally and Ted have had a contentious relationship at work (she believes he is trying to undermine her with her supervisor) and that, just before the accident a witness thinks he heard Sally (through her open car window) say something <span title="339" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-339">p. 339</span>suggesting that she intended to run into Ted. As a matter of law, that opens the door to punitive damages, which could be a multiple of the compensatory damages at stake—a prospect that might at first please Ted’s lawyer. But only at first: Many insurance policies do not cover damages for intentionally inflicted injuries or punitive damages. So, if Ted indeed proves that punitive damages are warranted (because Sally acted intentionally), he may thereby have taken the case outside the boundaries of insurance coverage! What should he do?</p>

<p id="c0aa803e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What about Peters, the plaintiff in our hypothetical auto collision case from Chapter 1? His automobile liability policy will provide counsel to defend against any counterclaim the other driver may bring, but it will not pay his attorneys’ fees to prosecute his claim as a plaintiff. A peculiarly American fee arrangement—the contingent fee—may, however, perform a similar function. In a contingent fee arrangement, the lawyer typically agrees to represent the client, with the fee to be paid from the proceeds of any settlement or recovery. A standard contingent fee arrangement might award the lawyer 20 percent of a settlement reached before filing suit, 25 percent if suit is filed but no further steps taken, 33 percent if the case goes to trial, and perhaps 50 percent if the case goes to appeal. In return for these hefty chunks taken from the plaintiff’s recovery, the lawyer agrees to forgo a fee entirely if there is no recovery: The plaintiff thus eliminates the risk of paying legal fees in a losing cause. For the client with limited funds the idea is often inviting—he pays only if he recovers something. No recovery means no fee.</p>
<p id="c0aa803f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most individual plaintiffs seeking damages for personal injuries enter into contingent fee arrangements, even when their finances would permit them to hire a lawyer on an hourly basis and even if they are offered alternatives.</p>
<p id="c0aa8040-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">People sometimes praise or malign the contingent fee system without understanding it. To understand it one must consider several perspectives: that of the individual client, the lawyer’s other clients, and the lawyer. The client is assured that he will not suffer out-of-pocket expenses for attorney’s fees, which may make the client more willing to bring a case where recovery is uncertain. Some have criticized and others have praised the system for this characteristic. This assurance (of a risk-free lawsuit for the client) comes at a cost that becomes apparent if one considers the position of the lawyer and the lawyer’s other clients. The lawyer, to be sure, does not charge the plaintiff any fees if the case is lost, but the lawyer has lost the value of his time and incurred expenses—if only such overhead items as rent, payment for digital resources, and paralegal services. Those expenses must be paid, and the only source of payment is the fees generated by clients who have recovered or settled. In setting fees, the lawyer must take the probability of success into account; fees from successful cases must be higher to cover the expenses incurred in unsuccessful cases. To that extent contingent fees cause the successful clients to bear part of the costs attributable to the unsuccessful clients.</p>
<p id="c0aa8041-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="340" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-340">p. 340</span>To describe it thus is not to condemn the arrangement; the winners are only going to pay legal fees if in fact they recover something, and the guarantee of no fee if they lose may be an assurance for which they would willingly pay the higher fee if they win. Indeed, the prevalence of such arrangements may suggest that all concerned find them satisfactory. An elaborate study of contingent fee lawyers found that their “effective hourly rate” (their mean hourly earnings including both winning and losing cases) was just a few dollars more than their counterparts in the insurance-retained defense bar. Herbert M. Kritzer, The Wages of Risk: The Returns of Contingency Fee Legal Practice, 47 DePaul L. Rev. 267 (1998). A more recent study by the Federal Judicial Center found that plaintiffs’ attorneys charging their clients by the hour “reported costs almost 25% higher than those using other billing methods (primarily contingency fee).” Emery G. Lee III &amp; Thomas E. Willging, Federal Judicial Center, Litigation Costs in Civil Cases: Multivariate Analysis, Reporting to the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Civil Rules 6 (2010).</p>
<p id="c0aa8042-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One can think of the contingent fee in several ways. For medieval and early modern lawyers it was an antisocial charge that stirred up dissension and disserved society.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109BD_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N109BD_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*3</a></span> This view, still prevalent in parts of the world today, makes a contingent fee a form of criminal activity.</p>
<p id="c0aaa754-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, one can see the contingent fee as a form of insurance. The client buys insurance against losing the case; the “premium” is her agreement that if she wins she’ll pay a share of her winnings to the lawyer. Just as all drivers who insure with a given insurance company share risks with their fellow-insureds, each contingent fee client pools his risk with that of the other clients of the same lawyer. So long as the lawyer is a good estimator of risks (or has a sufficiently large inventory of cases), the winners and the losers will balance out.</p>

<p id="c0aaf588-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the course of the nineteenth century, U.S. courts struggled with the question of whether either the contingent fee or liability insurance should be lawful.</p>
<p id="c0aaf589-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case against the contingent fee came from the common law’s antipathy to “stirring up trouble,” an antipathy that some historians would say was really antipathy about “the wrong sort of people” bringing lawsuits. By the end of the nineteenth century, U.S. courts, unlike their English counterparts, had decided it was lawful, although “careful Victorian[-era] lawyers gave it the same reception they gave ballroom dancing: that the masses engaged in it and the police did not intervene meant only that it was lawful,” not desirable. Wolfram, Modern Legal Ethics 527 (1986).</p>
<p id="c0aaf58a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unease with liability insurance had a different source: Some feared that it would encourage bad behavior. After all, if one takes seriously the idea that negligence is the failure to take reasonable precautions, then negligent defendants had acted in an “unreasonably dangerous” fashion. Some feared that allowing them to insure against the consequences would encourage them to behave in this socially undesirable way. By contrast, many states now require auto drivers and owners to carry liability insurance: Earlier generations might have shaken their heads sadly.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0aaf58b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, consider the contingent fee from the lawyer’s perspective. Take first the decision to represent a client. For the hourly fee lawyer, each bill-paying client is a source of income, no matter what the merits of her case. Not so for the contingent fee lawyer: For her, only the successful cases will yield any income. Moreover, <span title="342" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-342">p. 342</span>many cases will require substantial investment by the lawyer—fact investigators, expert witness fees, deposition travel—all of which have to be paid even if there is no recovery. So she may screen her cases more carefully than the hourly fee lawyer, turning away clients for whom recovery is unlikely or damages are likely to be low or uncollectible.</p>
<p id="c0aaf58c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another incentive may affect the lawyer once she takes the contingent fee case. All lawyers owe their clients the duties of loyalty and competence, but financial self-interest sometimes creates a tension with these ethical obligations. Hourly fee lawyers are paid for their work regardless of the merits of the case; they may, therefore, be tempted to spend more time on the case than it warrants. The contingent fee corrects this problem—by encouraging a lawyer to work as much as necessary to win the case (so that the plaintiff recovers) but not more than is necessary (because doing so would reduce his hourly rate). But the contingent fee creates its own tensions with ethical obligations. The contingent fee can make it far preferable from an attorney’s perspective to settle early, even if the plaintiff could recover more were she to wait. Suppose, for example, defendant makes a settlement offer of $10,000 after the plaintiff’s lawyer has worked for 10 hours on a case. If the retainer agreement provides that the plaintiff’s attorney receives 25 percent of any recovery, the attorney would receive $2,500—meaning that each hour of her time has yielded $250. Imagine that the plaintiff rejects the settlement, the plaintiff’s attorney works for another 40 hours on the case, and then defendant makes another settlement offer of $40,000. The plaintiff’s attorney’s 25 percent fee would amount to $10,000. This amount is larger in absolute terms, but results in a lower per hour fee: $200. The client has ultimate authority to decide whether to accept a settlement agreement, but one can imagine how these financial considerations might affect the lawyer’s advice if the client asks, as many clients do, whether the lawyer thinks a settlement offer should be accepted.</p>

<p id="c0ab1ca8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An ordinary banker would not enthusiastically welcome a lawyer applying for a loan with a lawsuit as the only collateral—in part because most bankers are not expert at valuing lawsuits. Over the past decade, however, new forms of litigation finance have emerged in which specialized lenders do essentially that. Some call this form of litigation finance “third-party” finance; others point out that insurers and contingent fee lawyers are themselves third-party financers and prefer “alternative” or “non-traditional” as a more accurate label.</p>
<p id="c0ab1ca9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whatever the label, the field has seen the proliferation of financing mechanisms. Thus far three principal groups of alternative litigation financers have emerged, each with a different business model.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10ABF_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10ABF_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*4</a></span></p>

<p id="c0ab1cab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Consumer Lending.</i></b> Some groups lend directly to clients (almost always plaintiffs in personal injury cases), giving them immediate cash in the form of a “loan” that will not be collected if the borrower does not collect a judgment. Moreover, the total repayment will never exceed the amount collected from the judgment or settlement. One study counted nearly 40 such firms in early 2010. If you have recently watched daytime television in any urban area, you will have encountered some of these lenders. They offer rates of interest that vary widely, from about 15 percent upwards and often increase as the time of the “loan” extends. Their business model seems to entail lending only a small percentage (generally 10 percent or less) of what they think might actually be recovered in the underlying lawsuit, often amounting to only a few thousand dollars. Anecdotes suggest that plaintiffs’ lawyers are often unhappy when their clients resort to such lenders because the amount that will have to be repaid often can make the client resist what the lawyers think are reasonable settlement offers. Such lenders present alternatives—higher priced alternatives—to an ordinary loan that a consumer might take out. One imagines that many of the borrowers are those who do not have access to ordinary loans, probably because they appear to be bad credit risks. Alternatively, some borrowers who understand the non-recourse feature of these loans may think of them as a <span title="344" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-344">p. 344</span>way of assuring that they will get some recovery from a lawsuit whose outcome is uncertain; it may be only a thousand dollars, but that’s better than nothing, their thinking might go.</p>
<p id="c0ab1cac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Lawyer Lending.</i></b> Like many businesses large and small, lawyers sometimes borrow to finance expenses incurred while waiting for clients to pay their bills (in the case of hourly fee lawyers) or for judgments and settlements to be paid (in the case of contingent fee lawyers). When the bank lends in such a situation, it is indirectly lending against the expected proceeds, not from a single lawsuit, but from the lawyer’s whole portfolio of cases. As one banker who writes loans to lawyers put it:</p>

<p id="c0ab1caf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Michael Grinfeld, Justice on Loan, 19 Cal. Law. 39, 40 (1999). Unlike banks, some lenders lend only to lawyers. These entities usually charge higher interest rates than do banks, for the same reason that the consumer lenders described above charge higher interest rates than banks—because the borrower, here the lawyer, is not a good credit risk. Should a lawyer have to disclose to a client that this is how he is financing his practice?</p>
<p id="c0ab1cb0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Direct Investment in Commercial Claims.</i></b> The preceding two models represent niche-market credit, in which neither lender does much investigation of particular claims. Not so with the third group of alternative financers, who invest directly in lawsuits. They will contract either with parties or with the parties’ lawyers, advancing money to finance particular pieces of litigation. Their business model calls for them to assess the merits of commercial litigation offered to them, then to advance sums ranging up to $100 million to finance that litigation; in return they get a share of any recovery. According to the available information (most of the investors in this market are not publicly traded, so information is spotty), they are interested only in major commercial litigation—principally in antitrust, intellectual property, and contract disputes—though one news account described a firm that was investing in divorce litigation of very wealthy individuals. One news report suggested that such funding has attractions both for lawyers and their clients and investors. For lawyers and clients, such funding enables them to undertake high-stakes litigation knowing that they can pursue a case as far as the merits take them. Investors include “pension funds, university endowments family offices and others [that] have collectively pumped more than a billion dollars into the sector in recent years.” Sara Randanzo, Litigation Finance Attracts New Set of Investors, Wall St. J. (May 15, 2016).</p>

The law firms and the entities seeking this form of litigation finance are almost without exception able to finance such litigation themselves, or to borrow at favorable rates to do so. Why, then, might they find this form of finance attractive? Though information is hard to come by, a couple of possibilities suggest themselves. First, the businesses concerned may not want to tie up this much of their working capital in litigation—as the news report just cited put it, such funding “give[s] corporations and law firms a way to shed risk from their balance sheets.” They are, after all, in business to make widgets or software or pharmaceuticals and may rather spend their money in an area where they are more familiar with the risks and rewards. An additional attraction might lie in getting a second opinion about the merits of their lawsuit. True, their own lawyers think their case is strong, but it might be reassuring to get another expert to vouch for that—and to back up the assessment by putting millions of dollars behind it. For a law firm the attractions may include the second-opinion feature; for a firm working on a contingent fee basis, accepting an investment of this type also eliminates some of the risk of a zero-recovery outcome.</p>
<p id="c0ab1cb2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The broad policy issues involved in this emerging form of finance are quite varied and made more difficult to assess by the circumstance that we have as yet relatively little experience with the form. Moreover, both enthusiasts and critics often make sweeping arguments that fail to distinguish this form of litigation investment from the preceding two.</p>
<p id="c0ab43c3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alongside the broad policy issues stand some more technical ones. Most states still have on their books prohibitions against champerty and maintenance. Some forms of alternative litigation finance would be unlawful were these laws applied according to their original medieval understandings. Should they be? Probably the strongest argument against such an interpretation emerges if one realizes that both the contingent fee (accepted in every state in the United States) and insurance would also violate the original understanding of these common law crimes. If the contingent fee is lawful, can it be a crime for nonlawyers to do what amounts to the same thing? It’s fair to say that working out thoughtful answers to this and other questions will take some time.</p>

Or, you can simply sell the patent to Buyer, who then owns it and can sue the alleged infringer: You realize some gain from the patent—whatever Buyer pays you for it—without the expense or uncertainty of a lawsuit. So common is this scenario that the term “patent troll” has come to define an entire business model based on the direct purchase of entire claims.

If you are injured in an automobile accident and your health insurer pays your medical bills, it is “subrogated” to your claim against the other driver: If you recover, the health insurer will insist on claiming from the proceeds the amounts it has paid to your doctors and hospital. The existence of subrogated claims ("liens” as they are often called in the trade jargon) may make the prospect of a lawsuit less attractive to your lawyer—because she knows that much of any eventual recovery may be consumed by the claim in subrogation.</p></li>

<p id="c0ab6ae3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Insurance will help only those who have it. Contingent fee systems will help only those who seek to recover money damages (and enough money damages to justify the lawyer’s investment of time). Alternative litigation finance will reach only segments of the market for legal services. That leaves substantial numbers of people who could benefit from legal counsel but who have no means to pay for it. But how substantial?</p>
<p id="c0ab6ae4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much depends on how the question is asked. Some would ask how many people would benefit—in the sense of improving their present position—from legal advice or representation but do not think they can spare the money for such assistance. Others would ask how many people handed say, $2,000 (about 20 hours of lawyer’s time at about the national median rate), would choose to spend it on legal fees. Legal services organizations often measure need by asking the first question, the response to which yields a picture of widespread unmet legal need. For example, the federally funded Legal Services Corporation (LSC) reported in 2013 that nearly 21 percent of Americans had incomes that qualified them for legal assistance, and the funded agencies are able to assist only a small fraction of that group. The response to the second question suggests that the demand is much lower. Debate occurs over which form of the question is the right one to ask.</p>
<p id="c0ab6ae5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However great the need, all agree that it’s concentrated in pockets. It helps to separate those needing legal services into plaintiffs and defendants and further to separate plaintiffs into those seeking damages and those seeking relief other than damages. Contingent fee arrangements “cover” people with meritorious claims for significant amounts—providing a market-based form of legal services for plaintiffs seeking money damages. Fee-shifting statutes (infra page 351) can help plaintiffs seeking smaller damages awards or injunctive relief for claims covered by those statutes. Class actions, powered by the common fund theory (infra page 350), can aggregate small claims—though such actions perform better at deterring defendants (and, some would add, compensating lawyers) than at compensating plaintiffs.</p>
<p id="c0ab6ae6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What about defendants? In a market economy, people with no insurance and no assets have a grim form of protection against lawsuits: Almost no one intentionally sues a judgment-proof defendant for damages. That leaves two good-sized groups without access to representation: individual plaintiffs with small claims (for whom the legal system has no good answer, regardless of wealth) and persons without liquid assets who are nevertheless sued. This latter group of defendants comprise two large subgroups: holdover tenants (their “asset” is the dwelling they are occupying); and spouses and parents sued for divorce and child custody (one cannot legally end a marriage or establish custody of a child without a court order).</p>
<p id="c0ab6ae7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whatever the measure of need, a range of local, state, and national efforts address it with varying degrees of success. Some of this representation is done by volunteers operating outside a formal organization—lawyers who donate time either as a professional obligation (some bar associations have established minimum amounts of donated time as an obligation of membership) or as a personal act of charity.</p>
<p id="c0ab6ae8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="348" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-348">p. 348</span>At the opposite pole from these individual acts of charity lie the institutions generically referred to as “legal aid.” These organizations get their funding from a combination of tax dollars from several levels of government and private philanthropic support. The largest single source of funding comes from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), a nonprofit organization established by Congress to award grants to legal assistance organizations across the country. In 2016, LSC had a budget of $388 million, and reported that the agencies it funded served 1,760,000 people and closed 736,400 cases. If one does the arithmetic, that amounts to about $200 per person and $516 per case—not an amount that would permit much in the way of legal services.</p>
<p id="c0ab6ae9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Legal aid offices typically employ lawyers who deliver assistance directly to clients who seek it. These institutions focus on people of small means faced with eviction, creditors’ suits, or domestic violence. They do not take cases that would yield a substantial money recovery, perhaps on the assumption that it is possible to find a lawyer who would take the matter on a contingency basis. Others have argued that such a defensive posture robs legal aid of the ability to challenge the conditions that underlie poverty and oppression in the United States. In the past, such programs have mounted challenges to the existing legal and social order. <i>Evans v. Jeff D</i>., discussed later in this chapter, was financed by legal aid lawyers. Such challenges have sometimes created opposition, especially when publicly subsidized lawyers question some part of the existing political order. In some instances legislatures have responded by trying to limit the kinds of legal work publicly subsidized lawyers can perform for their clients—for example, by forbidding them to sue state and local governments.</p>
<p id="c0ab91fa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If volunteer efforts by individual lawyers mark one end of the spectrum and institutionalized, publicly funded legal aid marks the other, intermediate forms have emerged in recent years that combine features of both systems. In one model, private law firms pledge support, both of money and professional time, to a small organization that functions as a point of client contact and a referral system, matching clients’ needs with available professional services. This enables a relatively small organization to deliver legal services many times greater than its budget. It also enables lawyers and firms to participate in pro bono activities with some assurance that they will get a steady flow of such work and that it will match their legal expertise and capacity. Because such organizations are funded by private donations, they also avoid some of the restrictions on practice that governmentally funded aid encounters.</p>
<p id="c0ab91fb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsidized legal services formed around a cause—an ethnic, religious, or political group with an agenda for social change—are still another form. The hallmark of such groups is that they solicit funds and memberships with the aim of using those funds to finance litigation that furthers the group’s goals. Such groups have been behind major social impact litigation on a range of issues at both ends of the political spectrum. The most prominent example is undoubtedly Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 443 (1954) (striking down racial segregation in public education), financed largely by the Legal Defense Fund of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a pioneer civil rights group. Analogous affinity groups have funded litigation seeking to advance agendas of reproductive <span title="349" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-349">p. 349</span>rights, environmental causes, and more. In recent decades, groups from the right side of the political spectrum have mounted their own litigation challenges, sometimes seeking to undo or roll back earlier impact litigation. Almost 50 years after <i>Brown</i>, the Supreme Court decided Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244 (2003), striking down a racial preference in admissions for the undergraduate college at the University of Michigan. <i>Gratz</i> was financed by the Center for Individual Rights, an organization describing itself as focusing on “defense of individual liberties against the increasingly aggressive and unchecked authority of” government. http://www.cir-usa.org/mission_new.html, visited August 25, 2018.</p>
<p id="c0ab91fc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, recall that every lawsuit receives some public subsidy: the amounts necessary to maintain the judicial establishment—everything from judges’ salaries to the electricity bill for the courthouse. Each federal district judgeship (including law clerks, secretarial help, and bailiffs) costs in excess of $500,000 annually just in salaries. This amount does not include real estate costs, the central clerk’s office, or general overhead. State judgeships, which are less well supported, would typically have lower costs, but even those costs are substantial. No litigant pays for these direct costs of adjudication. Moreover, the amount of the subsidy falls unevenly. For the great majority of litigants who file a complaint, engage in modest procedural maneuvering, and then settle, the subsidy is small. For litigants who proceed to trial, the subsidy is quite large.</p>

Contingent fees and insurance spread fees among particular groups of litigants; public subsidies spread costs among all citizens. There are other “spreading” devices that shade into fee shifting.</p>

<p id="c0ab9206-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff brings a lawsuit that benefits him, but in the process also benefits other similarly situated persons. Should those others have an obligation to contribute to the plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees? Yes, said the U.S. Supreme Court in the late nineteenth century, applying what it took to be a basic principle of equity. Trustees v. Greenough, 105 U.S. 527 (1881). The origin of this theory came in a suit in which a bondholder sued the bond issuer to force payment of the bond. The plaintiff had, by vindicating his interest, helped fellow bondholders to win a valuable legal right. The <i>Greenough</i> Court held that the original plaintiff could recover part of his attorney’s fee from the fund that his efforts had created—the sum from which the other bondholders would be paid. Notice that this common fund theory requires that the plaintiff’s efforts create some fund from which the lawyer’s fee can be deducted.</p>
<p id="c0abb917-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This judicially created doctrine has proved very important in financing class actions, in which one party or a few parties may represent a class of many thousands. If in such a case the class representatives win a judgment or settlement for money damages, they regularly seek a contribution to their fees from the fund created for the benefit of the class. Observe that the common fund theory does not itself shift fees from one party to the other; instead it requires that all who benefit from the recovery share its cost. The common fund theory shares fees among similarly situated persons rather than shifting them to the opposing party in a lawsuit.</p>

<p id="c0abb91d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You will likely have seen that the common fund applies only in the former case, because there is no pot of money created by the judgment in the latter. Because the common fund theory depends on a fund created by a judgment or settlement against the adversary, it straddles the line between fee spreading and fee shifting. We turn now to purer forms of fee shifting, in which the losing party pays the winner’s attorneys’ fees. When that happens, the so-called American Rule begins to shade into the English Rule. Since the early 1970s, an increasing amount of U.S. litigation <span title="351" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-351">p. 351</span>has involved the possibility for such fee shifting, a circumstance that has in turn created sublitigation about the conditions and circumstances for such shifting. Notice that such systems fall into two groups. In their purest form, such fee shifts are symmetrical; that is, the loser pays the winner’s fees. But some arrangements only allow some categories of winners to recover their fees from their opponents.</p>

<p id="c0abb920-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today a common form of symmetrical fee shifting arises from contractual agreements. Parties to contracts may provide that if litigation over the contract arises, the loser will pay the winner’s legal fees. A lawyer drafting a contract probably commits malpractice if she does not consider such a clause. In theory these provisions may be asymmetrical (tenant pays landlord’s lawyer if evicted; landlord doesn’t have to pay tenant’s lawyer if effort to evict fails), but courts have often interpreted asymmetrical clauses in contracts as symmetrical—loser pays winner’s lawyer. Loan agreements and leases often contain such clauses. When a landlord sues a tenant for rent, the tenant may be ordered to pay both the rent and the fee of the landlord’s lawyer. The reverse would be true if the tenant sued the landlord for constructive eviction. If the tenant’s lease had such a clause, how would it affect her incentives to sue or defend? One often finds such clauses in contracts where the amount in dispute will be relatively small. Do you see why?</p>

A well-established situation in which one side may pay the other’s legal fee occurs when a plaintiff has groundlessly brought a suit; in most states one element of damages in a subsequent action for malicious prosecution is attorneys’ fees for defending the first suit. Beyond any specific statutory authority lies the inherent power of the court to control behavior designed to thwart the just operation of the legal system. Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32 (1991) (upholding imposition of nearly $1 million in fees on party acting in bad faith). In an influential opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to create a generalized common law doctrine shifting fees in “public interest” cases but said that Congress remained free to do so.

<p id="c0abe039-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute says a court has “discretion” to award a “prevailing party” fees. Courts have interpreted these terms in ways a casual reader might not suspect. First, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that courts should ordinarily award such fees unless special circumstances render an award unjust—thus sharply limiting the court’s discretion. Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U.S. 87 (1989). Second, one might think that the statute created a symmetrical entitlement—that an employee who unsuccessfully sued her employer alleging job discrimination would have to pay the defendant’s legal fees. Not so, held Christianburg Garment Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 434 U.S. 412 (1978). In light of the legislative history suggesting that Congress wanted to make it easier, not harder, to enforce civil rights, the <i>Christianburg</i> Court interpreted the statute to permit routine attorneys’ fees awards to prevailing plaintiffs but not to prevailing defendants. A prevailing defendant could get fees only when the plaintiff’s claim was “frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.” Id. at 422. The Supreme Court recently made clear that a defendant can recover fees in a frivolous case resolved in defendant’s favor, regardless of whether dismissal was on the merits. CRST Van Expedited, Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 578 U.S. ___ (2016). Nevertheless, combined, these cases make clear that one-way fee shifting is the rule in civil rights litigation.</p>

How will this affect your estimate of your potential recovery in the case? Can you tell your client, at this moment, that you are no longer interested in representing her? Ethical rules restrict the ability of a lawyer to withdraw from representation for financial reasons to circumstances in which “the representation will result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer.” Model Rule 1.16(a)(5). Losing money on a case in which the lawyer thought he would make money does not qualify as an unreasonable financial burden.</p></li>

<p id="c0ac074e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A plaintiff who prevails at trial on a claim for which §1988 applies will be a “prevailing plaintiff” under this statute. Rule 54(d)(2) establishes a procedure for seeking, contesting, and awarding such fees. But most cases will settle before trial. In such cases, the parties can negotiate about fees as well as the portion of the settlement going to the plaintiff. This situation provides an opportunity for the defendant to drive a wedge between lawyer and client, a wedge whose sharpness and power the problem below—based on a seminal Supreme Court case—illustrates.</p>

<p id="c0ac0751-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You are a lawyer in a medium-sized firm in a medium-sized city. Wanting to serve the public interest—and maybe get some valuable experience in the process—you volunteer to work on a pro bono case your firm has recently taken on. Your clients are the parents of children with serious developmental disabilities who are cared for in a state institution. The parents seek your firm out because recent work by child psychologists and psychiatrists suggests that, with appropriate treatment, children like these can make far greater educational and social progress than has previously been thought. But the state institution is not giving them such treatment. Federal law gives to all children, including those with special needs, the right to an “appropriate” education. You and your colleagues do research that leads you to believe that the state is failing to provide your clients’ children with such an education and that they have a viable legal claim. It will likely cost a good deal to pursue this claim (involving a good deal of expert testimony), and your clients lack the financial resources to fund the case. The pro bono committee of your firm nevertheless authorizes the representation, in part because if your clients prevail, you will be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. §1988(b) quoted above. Having obtained your clients’ authorization you bring suit in federal district court on their behalf; because there are several hundred parents in the group, you pursue the case as a class action under Rule 23 (more extensively discussed in Chapter 12). The complaint seeks extensive changes in the treatment regime of the children, seeking an injunction that will order those changes. You do not seek damages on behalf of the class. The case progresses, with many motions over the qualifications of various experts, exchanges of reports of experts, depositions, extensive examination of the children’s medical records and more, <span title="354" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-354">p. 354</span>all of which consumes substantial amounts of your firm’s time and a considerable amount of money advanced to cover such things as experts’ fees.</p>

Some attorneys have tried through retainer agreements in which their clients promise that they will reject any settlement offer that includes a waiver of fees. But such agreements have been found to be unethical because they restrict a client’s ability to accept or reject settlement offers. Another alternative retainer agreement addresses this issue by providing that a client can accept a settlement that does not include fees but then becomes obligated to pay her attorneys a reasonable fee based on their hourly rate and number of hours spent on the case. Such agreements preserve a client’s ability to accept a settlement offer that waives the entitlement to attorneys’ fees, but imposes significant costs on the client who does so.</p></li>

In 1998, the West Virginia Legislature enacted two bills eliminating the “self-preservation” requirement, and respondents moved to dismiss the case as moot. The District Court granted the motion, finding that the 1998 legislation had eliminated the allegedly offensive provisions and that there was no indication that the West Virginia Legislature would repeal the amendments. Petitioners requested attorney’s fees as the “prevailing party” under the FHAA, 42 U.S.C. §3613(c)(2) ("[T]he court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party. . . . a reasonable attorney’s fee and costs"). . . . Petitioners argued that they were entitled to attorney’s fees under the “catalyst theory,” which posits that a plaintiff is a “prevailing party” if it achieves the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant’s conduct.

They also claim that the rejection of the “catalyst theory” will deter plaintiffs with meritorious but expensive cases from bringing suit. We are skeptical of these assertions, which are entirely speculative and unsupported by any empirical evidence.</p>
<p id="c0ac558e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners discount the disincentive that the “catalyst theory” may have upon a defendant’s decision to voluntarily change its conduct, conduct that may not be illegal. “The defendant’s potential liability for fees in this kind of litigation can be as significant as, and sometimes even more significant than, their potential liability on the merits,” <i>Evans v.

<p id="c0ad1814-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q1.</b> B is the only correct response. Contract cases dominate the civil docket, and more than half of them are actions to collect debts. A is wrong because filings have been flat or decreased in recent years. C is wrong because substantially more contract than tort claims are filed. D is wrong because about 98 percent of civil litigation occurs in state courts.</p>
<p id="c0ad1815-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q2.</b> B and C are the only correct responses. A is wrong because trials, much less jury trials, will occur only in a small minority of cases. D is wrong because the average case in which the plaintiff prevails results—for both torts and bench-tried contract claims—in judgments between $10,000 and $50,000.</p>
<p id="c0ad1816-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q3.</b> B is the only correct answer; such parties will typically pay their own lawyers (unless the contract in question calls for the loser to pay the winner’s fee). A is wrong because almost all such cases will involve a contingent fee lawyer representing the plaintiff and an insurer-paid lawyer representing the defendant. C is wrong because a fee-shifting statute will give fees to a prevailing plaintiff. D is wrong because under the common fund theory, the plaintiff’s lawyer will collect his fee from the award that will be distributed to the plaintiff class.</p>
<p id="c0ad1817-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4.</b> B and C are the correct responses. A is wrong because the quoted formula is ancient law jargon contending that the “legal"—meaning available at common law—remedies are inadequate and the court should therefore exercise its equitable powers. Along with those powers comes the court’s duty to consider not only the parties’ interests but those of the public. See <i>Lucy Webb Hayes Natl. Training School v. Geoghegan</i> (supra page 308) and <i>Winter v. NRDC</i> (supra page 316).</p>

B is not correct because, though the federal fee-shifting statute reads as if it contemplated a loser pays winner regime, it has been consistently interpreted to mean that a prevailing plaintiff can collect fees from the defendant, but a prevailing defendant cannot collect from the plaintiff (unless the court finds that the plaintiff’s claim was in bad faith). C is incorrect because a fee award requires a judgment; settlement or a change of position by defendant is not enough. <i>Buckhannon</i> (supra page 355). Note, however, that the settlement provisions may provide for a fee to the lawyer, or the plaintiff may pay her lawyer from settlement proceeds.</p>
<p id="c0ad1819-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q6.</b> C is the only correct response. In A and B there will be notice, as well as a hearing—although a truncated one. D is wrong because the courts do allow temporary restraining orders to be issued without notice, though only in the sorts of extreme circumstances contemplated in Rule 65(b).</p>
<p id="c0ad181a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q7.</b> B is the only correct response. A is wrong because even when due process does apply, it often requires only the opportunity for a hearing, which will occur only if asked for. C is wrong because, although due process does require the uniform application of procedures, it also requires that the procedures be fundamentally fair—not just that they be uniform. D is spectacularly wrong: The hallmark of the modern Due Process Clause is its flexibility—what process is “due” depends to an extraordinary degree on the circumstances of the case.</p>

For if an applicant for the writ knows that he is dealing with an uneducated, uninformed consumer with little access to legal help and little familiarity with legal procedures, there may be a substantial possibility that a summary seizure of property—however unwarranted—may go unchallenged, and the applicant may feel that he can act with impunity.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c0a8fa39-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="#ftN106E3_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" id="note-N106E3_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">22</a></span>&nbsp;A prior hearing always imposes some costs in time, effort, and expense, and it is often more efficient to dispense with the opportunity for such a hearing. But these rather ordinary costs cannot outweigh the constitutional right. Procedural due process is not intended to promote efficiency or accommodate all possible interests: it is intended to protect the particular interests of the person whose possessions are about to be taken.</p>

<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c0a8fa3a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">The establishment of prompt efficacious procedures to achieve legitimate state ends is a proper state interest worthy of cognizance in constitutional adjudication. But the Constitution recognizes higher values than speed and efficiency. Indeed, one might fairly say of the Bill of Rights in general, and the Due Process Clause in particular, that they were designed to protect the fragile values of a vulnerable citizenry from the overbearing concern for efficiency and efficacy that may characterize praiseworthy government officials no less, and perhaps more, than mediocre ones.</p>

In three cases, the Court has allowed the attachment of property without a prior hearing. In one, the attachment was necessary to protect the public against the same sort of immediate harm involved in the seizure cases—a bank failure. Coffin Bros. &amp; Co. v. Bennett, 277 U.S. 29. Another case involved attachment necessary to secure jurisdiction in state court—clearly a most basic and important public interest. Ownbey v. Morgan, 256 U.S. 94. It is much less clear what interests were involved in the third case, decided with an unexplicated per curiam opinion simply citing <i>Coffin Bros.</i> and <i>Ownbey</i>. McKay v. McInnes, 279 U.S. 820.
