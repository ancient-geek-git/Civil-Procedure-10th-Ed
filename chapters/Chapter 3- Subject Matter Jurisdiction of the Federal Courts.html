<p id="c0928bb4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Personal jurisdiction doctrine limits both state and federal courts in relation to particular defendants. If the defendant lacks connection with the forum state, due process forbids courts sitting in that state from rendering a judgment that will bind that defendant.</p>
<p id="c0928bb5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts and lawyers in the United States must also cope with a second jurisdictional boundary—this one between the powers of state and federal courts. The Constitution created a federal government but made the federal government supreme only in certain areas. In other areas the states are sovereign, and in still others federal and state governments share power.</p>
<p id="c0928bb6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The centuries since the ratification of the Constitution have seen numerous political struggles and a bloody civil war fought over the location of the line between state and federal powers. That continuing struggle is reflected in the realm of civil procedure. State and federal governments both have court systems. But because of limits on federal power, federal courts can hear only certain kinds of cases. Consequently, litigants, their lawyers, and federal judges need to know whether a particular kind of case must be filed in federal court. Other kinds of cases can only be filed in state court. And in many others, both state <i>and</i> federal courts are available. Lawyers describe this sorting of cases between court systems as “subject matter jurisdiction.”</p><span title="206" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-206">p. 206</span>

<ul class="">
<li><p id="c092d9e5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Chapter 2, we assumed that the court in question could hear the <i>kind of case</i> at issue—Neff’s trespass action against Pennoyer, the Robinsons’ tort claim against World-Wide and Audi, Ms. Abdouch’s right-of-privacy claim against Mr. Lopez, and so on. The only question was whether the court had the power to enter a judgment against a particular <i>defendant</i>—given the defendant’s connection with the state.</p></li>
<li><p id="c092d9e6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this chapter we will flip those assumptions, taking for granted that the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Instead we’ll ask whether the Constitution and the relevant statutes authorize a <i>federal court</i> to hear this case or whether only a state court can hear it.</p></li>
<li><p id="c092d9e7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To have the requisite authority, a federal district court must have <i>both</i> personal jurisdiction over the defendant <i>and</i> subject matter jurisdiction over the kind of case. The two forms of jurisdiction are <i>not</i> substitutes for each other, a point reflected in the circumstance that Rule 12 devotes separate subsections (12(b)(1) and 12(b)(2)) to these distinct challenges.</p></li>

<p id="c092d9e9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A sketch of constitutional history reveals several political compromises that shape the structure of federal judicial jurisdiction. Read Article III, the portion of the Constitution devoted to the judiciary. You won’t be surprised to see that §1 of this Article establishes a Supreme Court. But you may be surprised to learn that the Constitution views other federal courts as optional. Section 1 authorizes, but does not require, Congress to establish lower federal courts—what we know <span title="207" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-207">p. 207</span>today as the courts of appeals and the district courts. Putting the question of lower federal courts into Congress’s hands represented a compromise between those who feared an overly powerful federal government and those who viewed the establishment of federal courts as one of the most important goals of the new government. The compromise left the issue subject to changeable legislative wishes. In fact, the first Congress created lower federal courts, and their existence has never been in serious doubt since, though the exact scope of their powers has often been questioned.</p>
<p id="c092d9ea-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 2 of Article III contains a second compromise, one whose terms have been fiercely contested for more than 200 years. Article III, §2 limits federal courts’ jurisdiction to the list set forth in §2. By implication a case not listed in Article III, §2 may not be heard in a federal court. Such a case could be heard only in a state court. Within the boundaries of Article III, however, Congress remains free to bestow all or some of the constitutionally permissible jurisdiction on the lower federal courts.</p>
<p id="c092d9eb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This history has implications even in ordinary lawsuits. Because the federal courts are courts of <i>limited jurisdiction</i>, two questions lurk at the threshold of every case brought in a federal court: Does the case fall within one of the enumerated categories of Article III, §2; and has Congress further authorized the lower federal courts to assume that jurisdiction?</p>
<p id="c092d9ec-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 8(a)(1) reflects these concerns by requiring every federal complaint to begin with a “short and plain statement of the grounds for the court’s jurisdiction.” In judging those jurisdictional statements, the courts look to three bodies of law—the Constitution, the statutes conferring jurisdiction, and the case law interpreting both.</p>
<p id="c09300fd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Skimming the jurisdictional statutes, one might not suspect another important feature: Federal courts share much of their jurisdiction with state courts.</p>
<p id="c09300fe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "></p><div style="width:100%" class="epub-image-container" id="c09300ff-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"><div class="epub-image "><img alt="A Venn diagram illustrates jurisdiction." src="./Chapter 3- Subject Matter Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts_files/9781543808094_Ch03-1.png" style="max-width:100%" aria-describedby="img-longdesc-c09300ff-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"></div></div><p></p>

It grants federal courts jurisdiction over cases that arise under federal law. That federal courts have such jurisdiction does not seem surprising, but it may be surprising to learn that they do not have exclusive jurisdiction over such cases. So far as Congress and the Constitution are concerned, cases arising under federal law can be brought in state as well as federal courts. Lawyers describe such shared jurisdiction as <i>concurrent</i>. Like general federal question cases, diversity jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. §1332) is also concurrent. In some instances Congress has made federal jurisdiction exclusive. (28 U.S.C. §§1333 (admiralty), 1334 (bankruptcy), and 1346(b) (tort suits based on negligence of a federal employee).) For an example of a statute carefully discriminating between grants of concurrent and exclusive federal jurisdiction, read 28 U.S.C. §1338. In still other instances Congress has specifically forbidden federal courts from hearing cases that might otherwise fall within their jurisdiction; for example, 28 U.S.C. §1341 forbids federal courts from enjoining state tax collection in most circumstances.</p>
<p id="c0932817-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why would a lawyer or a litigant care whether a state or federal court heard her case? Assuming some court is available, why should it matter which one? The answer has both practical and political dimensions. As a tactical matter, the reasons for seeking a federal rather than a state court range from the practical (some federal courts presently have shorter waiting times until trial than their state counterparts) to the strategic (is the defendant likely to get a more sympathetic hearing from the local state judge than from the federal judge in a city at the other end of the state; will a six-person federal jury, drawn from a broader geographic area and required to reach a unanimous verdict, be likely to award higher—or lower—damages than the state jury, which may have 12 members and may be allowed to reach a non-unanimous majority verdict; is the federal bench generally more liberal or conservative than the state court bench in the particular jurisdiction?) to the crafty (is the opposing lawyer uncomfortable with the generally more formal conduct and faster pace of federal litigation?).</p>
<p id="c0932818-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On a different plane, note that Article III, §1 gives federal judges lifetime tenure, a protection that shields them from political pressure. So a litigant with a legally strong but unpopular claim or defense might prefer federal court. The limited jurisdiction of the federal courts also shields them, however, from certain kinds of cases: Family law disputes, for example, are not part of the federal docket. These dual insulations—from political pressure and from a broad caseload—may work in opposite directions. Arguing that federal courts possess a range of virtues ranging from greater competence to “class-based predilections favorable to constitutional enforcement,” a civil rights litigator once argued that in virtually every conceivable situation the federal courts would be more hospitable to his clients’ claims. Bert Neuborne, <i>The Myth of Parity</i>, 90 Harv. L. Rev. 1105 (1977). More recently, another similar litigator argued that for his gay and lesbian clients, the state courts’ closer ties both to the local community and their broad mix of cases made them the superior forum. William Rubenstein, <i>The Myth of Superiority</i>, 16 Const. Comment. 599 (2000). So even experienced lawyers believe it matters whether a state or a federal court hears the case—even in instances when the two courts would be applying the same substantive law. This proposition sets the stage for an exploration of federal subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

<p id="c0934f3a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, most would intuitively assume that federal trial courts have jurisdiction to hear all cases involving federal law. In fact, that assumption has not been true for much of the nation’s history and is true today only in a limited form. Why? To answer that question, we must look again at constitutional history.</p>
<p id="c0934f3b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1789, Congress exercised its authority under Article III to create what the Constitution calls “inferior” federal courts. But Congress has only bestowed upon those courts some of the jurisdiction allowed under Article III. Among the most important early grants of jurisdiction were diversity and admiralty. Combined, these two jurisdictional grants gave federal courts jurisdiction over most significant interstate and international trade.</p>
<p id="c0934f3c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most striking from a modern perspective was the absence of any general federal question jurisdiction. There were individual statutes allowing suits invoking patent and federal pension laws, but federal courts had no general power to entertain claims based on federal law. That may not have mattered much in an age when there weren’t enough federal statutes to create a lot of such claims.</p>
<p id="c093764d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the Civil War had reshaped understandings of federalism and, in particular, the federal courts’ role in the enforcement of civil rights, Congress in 1875 enacted a general federal question statute.</p>
<p id="c093764e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, three kinds of cases dominate the federal district court civil docket— federal question cases are almost half, diversity cases a bit more than a third, and cases that land in federal court because the United States is a party, 15 percent.</p>

<p id="c0937650-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difficulty comes in deciding what it means for a case to “arise under” federal law.

To settle their claims, the railroad in 1871 gave them a lifetime pass good for free transportation on the line. Several decades later, Congress, believing that railroads were using free transportation to bribe public officials, made free passes unlawful. The railroad thereupon refused to honor the Mottleys’ passes, citing the new federal legislation. The Mottleys sued in federal court seeking specific performance of their settlement. “The bill[, that is, the complaint,] further alleges: First, that the act of Congress referred to does not prohibit the giving of passes under the circumstances of this case; and, second, that if the law is to be construed as prohibiting such passes, it is in conflict with the Fifth Amendment of the constitution, because it deprives the plaintiffs of their property without due process of law. The defendant demurred to the bill.” The federal trial court overruled the demurrer and granted the Mottleys the relief they had requested. Defendant railroad appealed to the Supreme Court.]</p>

They are, first, whether that part of the act of Congress of June 29, 1906 (34 Stat. 584), which forbids the giving of free passes or the collection of any different compensation for transportation of passengers than that specified in the tariff filed, makes it unlawful to perform a contract for transportation of persons, who in good faith, before the passage of the act, had accepted such contract in satisfaction of a valid cause of action against the railroad; and, second, whether the statute, if it should be construed to render such a contract unlawful, is in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. We do not deem it necessary, however, to consider either of these questions, because, in our opinion, the court below was without jurisdiction of the cause. Neither party has questioned that jurisdiction, but it is the duty of this court to see to it that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, which is defined and limited by statute, is not exceeded. This duty we have frequently performed of our own motion.</p>
<p id="c0939d6b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There was no diversity of citizenship and it is not and cannot be suggested that there was any ground of jurisdiction, except that the case was a “suit. . . . arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.” [The Court cited the then-current version of the “arising under” jurisdiction statute.] It is the settled interpretation of these words, as used in this statute, conferring jurisdiction, that a suit arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States only when the plaintiff’s statement of his own cause of action shows that it is based upon those laws or that Constitution. It is not enough that the plaintiff alleges some anticipated defense to his cause of action and asserts that the defense is invalidated by some provision of the Constitution of the United States. Although such allegations show that very likely, in the course of the litigation, a question under the Constitution would arise, they do not show that the suit, that is, the plaintiff’s original cause of action, arises under the Constitution. In Tennessee v. Union &amp; Planters’ Bank, 152 U.S. 454, the plaintiff, the State of Tennessee, brought suit in the Circuit Court of the United States to recover from the defendant certain taxes alleged to be due under the laws of the State. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant claimed an immunity from the taxation by virtue of its charter, and that therefore the tax was void, because in violation of the provision of the Constitution of the United States, which forbids any State from passing a law impairing the obligation of contracts. The cause was held to be beyond the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, the court saying, by Mr. Justice Gray, “a suggestion of one party, that the other will or may set up a claim under the Constitution or laws of the United States, does not make the suit one arising under that Constitution or those laws.” Again, in Boston &amp; Montana Consolidated Copper &amp; Silver Mining Company v. Montana Ore Purchasing Company, 188 U.S. 632, the. . . . cause was held to be beyond the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, the court saying, by Mr. Justice Peckham:</p>

<p id="c093c490-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Mottley</i> exemplifies the “well-pleaded complaint” rule, one rather rigid but widely used approach to a difficult problem. Can one justify this approach? An enormous number of claims have some federal ingredient in their background. For example, as Charles Wright pointed out, land title in most western states can be traced back to U.S. land grants. Wright, Federal Courts 104. Large numbers of checks and online payments clear through Federal Reserve banks. Does every question of land title or every suit on a bad check arise under federal law and thus belong in federal court? If one answers that question “no,” then one has to find a principled way of sorting claims in which federal questions have some central importance from those in which they are merely background assumptions.</p>
<p id="c093c491-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Mottley</i> chooses to sort roughly, based on the pleadings: The federal claim must appear as part of a well-pleaded complaint. That approach has at least one important advantage: It permits the sorting to occur at the start of the lawsuit before the parties and court have invested much time. To see the force of this point, consider the opposite extreme: One could, theoretically, postpone a decision on jurisdiction until after trial, to see whether an important question of federal law had emerged, and dismiss if it had not, allowing the case to start all over in state court. Not too surprisingly, not even the fiercest critic of <i>Mottley</i> has suggested taking things this far. Yet the <i>Mottley</i> approach eliminates cases from federal court, like <i>Mottley</i> itself, in which the central issue was a federal defense rather than a part of the plaintiff’s claim.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c093c492-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear that the restrictive reading <i>Mottley</i> (and numerous other cases) gives to “arising under” is not constitutionally required. Why? After all, both Article III and §1331 speak of cases “arising under” federal law; could that phrase mean different things in the Constitution and in the statute? Yes: The Supreme Court in several cases has said that the meaning of “arising under” in Article III is broader than the same phrase in §1331. Consider what that means.</p>

Be sure you understand why before moving on.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c093eba4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a further corollary, Congress could change the result in <i>Mottley</i> by amending §1331.

<li class=""><p id="c093eba5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a defendant challenges federal question jurisdiction in district court, one of three questions commonly arises:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c093eba6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is there a federal issue at all? If the plaintiff’s claim is based on some federal statute or regulation, the problem consists in interpreting legislation. If the plaintiff claims the right to relief under federal common law, the question is whether such federal common law exists.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c093eba7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming there is a federal issue, does it “give rise to” plaintiff’s claim? That is the question in <i>Mottley</i>.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c093eba8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If there is a federal issue that is not the basis for plaintiff’s claim, is it sufficiently important to “federalize” the case?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c093eba9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although <i>Mottley</i>’s bright-line test suggests that the answer to 5c is a simple “no,” it turns out that things are a bit more complicated.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c093ebaa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alongside the broad and straight mainstream view reflected in <i>Mottley</i> flows a narrow and meandering rivulet. In this second line of cases the federal courts have assumed “arising under” jurisdiction on the basis of something less—or different—than a claim depending on federal law. Smith v. Kansas City Title &amp; Trust Co., 255 U.S. 180 (1921), is the poster child for this more expansive view. In <i>Smith</i>, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant bank as trustee had violated a state law allowing it to invest only in legal securities. Thus stated, the suit would seem to arise entirely under state law regulating trustees. But the allegedly “illegal” securities were bonds issued by a federal agency under a federal law that plaintiff claimed was unconstitutional. Held: “arising under” jurisdiction. Is <i>Mottley</i>, not cited in <i>Smith</i>, distinguishable?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c093ebab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has repeatedly tried to define this line of cases, without bringing great clarity to the topic. The Supreme Court’s most recent effort came in Grable &amp; Sons Metal Prod. Inc. v. Darue Eng’g &amp; Mfg., 545 U.S. 308 (2005). Land was sold to satisfy an Internal Revenue Service lien for unpaid taxes. To assure that it had clean title, the purchaser of the land brought a quiet title action in state court, at which point the original owner of the land challenged title, alleging that the notice of the tax lien sale was inadequate. Defendant sought to remove to federal court, arguing that the underlying issue was the adequacy of the IRS system of notice in its tax sales. Federal question jurisdiction was proper, said the Court. In a unanimous opinion, <i>Grable</i> set out a three-part test for such federalized claims: “[T]he question is, does a state-law claim [1] necessarily raise a federal issue, [2] actually <span title="215" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-215">p. 215</span>disputed and substantial, [3] which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.” Id. at 314. Lower courts interpreting this test have overwhelmingly remanded such cases to state courts, usually concluding, without much analysis, that the case fails the third of the <i>Grable</i> criteria.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c093ebac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What’s going on in this “broader” <i>Smith</i> line of cases, cases like <i>Grable</i>? One way of explaining them is to say that the courts thought the federal law interests were important. Important in what way? A monumentally important case with a federal ingredient will eventually make its way to the Supreme Court, which, you’ll recall, has a broader “arising under” jurisdiction than do the district courts. For these cases it makes little difference whether the case is initially heard in a state or federal court.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c093ebad-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the Supreme Court currently hears fewer than a hundred cases a year. So as a practical matter most federal issues litigated in state courts will never reach any federal court. The battle in the statutory “arising under” cases is fought over which federal issue cases should be heard in federal trial and intermediate appellate courts. One thoughtful analysis puts the question like this:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c093ebae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Federal issues might be raised in a large number of cases, but the claimants of federal rights often are wrong in their view that federal law protects them. They would therefore lose on the federal issue, and they could win only on state law grounds. If “arising under” were interpreted expansively, many cases in federal court on the basis of “arising under” jurisdiction would be disposed of on state law grounds. . . . What is needed is a test that will screen out cases in which federal interests are unlikely to be strongly implicated. Can the following considerations be combined to produce a “test”? (i) What is the national interest in disposing of the case as a whole—with federal fact-finding—in the federal courts, as compared to the interest of disposing of it in the state courts? (ii) How likely is it that the national interest will in fact be implicated? (iii) How likely is it that the Supreme Court will use its limited resources to decide the federal issue where the record is made in the state court?</p>

<p id="c09412c9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Effective lawyers practicing in federal court must learn the sometimes complex boundaries of federal subject matter jurisdiction. They must also learn the consequences of various strategic decisions associated with raising the lack of subject matter jurisdiction in a case. Suppose, for example, you represent a defendant in a case filed in federal district court and you think that there is no basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction over one or more claims in the case. You also think that there’s an argument that the claim should be dismissed on Rule 12(b)(6) grounds, for failure to state a claim. You move to dismiss under both Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6). Does it matter how that motion to dismiss is decided?</p>

All the dismissal established was that the claim did not arise under federal law; that’s entirely consistent with its arising under state law.</p></li>
<li><p id="c09438db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the federal court grants the Rule 12(b)(6) motion and the plaintiff refiles the same claim in state court, can defendant argue that the federal dismissal requires dismissal of the state claim? As you will see in Chapter 11, except under special circumstances, a federal Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal operates as a judgment on the merits disposing of the claim. A state court is bound to respect that judgment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="c09438dc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose you represent a defendant in a case filed in federal district court and you think that there are grounds to bring a motion to dismiss both for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for lack of personal jurisdiction. If either challenge is well founded, the case will be dismissed. But a dismissal will have different consequences for a refiled suit, depending on which ground is used for dismissal.</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="c09438dd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a case is dismissed for want of federal subject matter jurisdiction, a plaintiff is free to refile the suit in state court because the judgment establishes only the lack of federal jurisdiction, leaving the state court open.</p></li>

<li><p id="c09438df-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under those circumstances, should a federal court faced with motions to dismiss on both grounds always take subject matter jurisdiction first, because that will have the narrowest subsequent effect? No, the Supreme Court has said; the discretion of a trial court to handle its docket allows it to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction if that is the most obvious ground, even though that will preclude subsequent state-court litigation in that state. Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U.S. 574 (1999).</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="c09438e0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now suppose that the defendant does not move to dismiss. Is the objection to subject matter jurisdiction waived? No: As <i>Mottley</i> demonstrates, the requirement of subject matter jurisdiction is held to be so fundamental that a court is required to raise the issue <i>sua sponte</i> (on the court’s own motion) and dismiss if it finds a lack of jurisdiction. In Capron v. Van Noorden, 6 U.S. 126 (1804), plaintiff sued defendant in federal court and lost. On appeal in the Supreme Court, plaintiff suggested a lack of jurisdiction because of lack of diversity. The Supreme Court dismissed the case, leaving the plaintiff free to try again in state court (assuming that the statute of limitations had not yet run).</p>
<p id="c09438e1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the draconian rules about the nonwaivability of federal subject matter jurisdiction, one might expect it would be easy to mount a collateral attack on a judgment alleged to be without federal jurisdiction. In fact, the answer is “probably not,” though the few cases that have dealt with this question have not been <span title="218" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-218">p. 218</span>resolved consistently. To get a feel for the problem, consider three situations: (1) defendant appears, challenges subject matter jurisdiction and loses; (2) defendant appears, fails to challenge subject matter jurisdiction, but loses on the merits; and (3) defendant defaults. In each case, the question is whether in a second lawsuit the former defendant may seek to avoid the effect of the first judgment by arguing that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="c09438e2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Parties who appear, challenge the subject matter jurisdiction of a federal court, and lose are bound by that determination; just as with personal jurisdiction, they may not thereafter challenge the judgment in a second action. Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U.S. 165 (1938).</p></li>
<li><p id="c09438e3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, and again as with personal jurisdiction, parties who have appeared but failed to challenge the subject matter jurisdiction of a district court may generally not thereafter attack its judgment in another court for lack of diversity or federal question jurisdiction—absent a statute authorizing such a challenge. Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank, 308 U.S. 371 (1939); Kalb v. Feuerstein, 308 U.S. 433 (1940).</p></li>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0946001-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to provide a federal forum for plaintiffs who seek to vindicate federal rights, Congress has conferred on the district courts original jurisdiction in federal-question cases—civil actions that arise under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. 28 U.S.C. §1331. In order to provide a neutral forum for what have come to be known as diversity cases, Congress also has granted district courts original jurisdiction in civil actions between citizens of different States, between U.S. citizens and foreign citizens, or by foreign states against U.S. citizens. §1332.</p>

<p id="c0946003-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An early case relying on the neutral forum justification while making important law regarding diversity jurisdiction was Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. 267 (1806). Although 28 U.S.C. §1332 does not by its terms require that each plaintiff be diverse from each defendant, that interpretation was attached to the predecessor statute by Chief Justice Marshall in <i>Strawbridge</i>, and has been unquestioned law ever since. Thus even in a case with multiple diverse parties the existence of a single party with the same state citizenship as that of an opposing party will destroy diversity. The theory, apparently, was that if citizens of the same state are on both sides of a case, a state court cannot discriminate against an out-of-state party without harming its own. As an opinion written more than 200 years after <i>Strawbridge</i> explained it:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0948714-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The complete diversity requirement is not mandated by the Constitution, or by the plain text of §1332(a). The Court, nonetheless, has adhered to the complete diversity rule in light of <i>the purpose of the diversity requirement, which is to provide a federal forum for important disputes where state courts might favor, or be perceived as favoring, home-state litigants</i>. The presence of parties from the same State on both sides of a case dispels this concern, eliminating a principal reason for conferring §1332 jurisdiction over any of the claims in the action.</p>

<p id="c0948716-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But in some instances Congress has legislated in ways suggesting a broader function for diversity than providing a neutral forum.

The idea would be that some cases have national scope and implication and should be heard in a federal court, even if the governing law is state law. For our purposes the question is not whether the “neutral forum” or the “national case” justification for diversity is correct. Instead it is how uncertainty about diversity’s purpose plays itself out in the cases.</p>

But for jurisdiction to exist under (a)(2) plaintiff would need to be a citizen of a foreign state, not merely a resident, and the complaint itself alleges that plaintiff is a citizen of the United States. Thus the case does not involve an action between citizens of the United States and a citizen of a foreign state. There is no jurisdiction under §1332(a)(2).</p>
<p id="c094ae33-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In responding to the motion, plaintiff does not really defend the idea of jurisdiction based upon his location in France, but shifts the ground to a discussion of his connection with California. Plaintiff has filed an affidavit stating that he was raised and educated in California commencing in 1948, and that while he has resided in France for the last several years (his attorney’s brief says since 1990), he has maintained certain contacts with California, including a license to practice law, and a law office there which he states he has visited at least four times a year since living abroad. He has a California driver’s license. He recently solicited two San Francisco law offices for possible employment, although there is no indication of any affirmative <span title="221" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-221">p. 221</span>response.

<p id="c094ae34-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To the extent that plaintiff now argues for a California domicile, it would appear that he might be attempting to lay a basis for jurisdiction under §1332(a)(1).

A person is a citizen of a state of the United States within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. §1332 if he is a citizen of the United States and is domiciled within the state in question. Newman-Green Inc. v.

<li class=""><p id="c094ae41-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, because the statute does not define the meaning of state “citizenship,” and because, unlike the national government, states do not issue any formal documents to show that one is a “citizen” of California or Florida or Illinois, courts have developed a test of state citizenship. The standard doctrinal formulation says that state citizenship depends on present domicile and intent to remain indefinitely. That test is easy to apply for most people, who have a single clear affiliation.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c094ae42-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But, like Mr. Redner, many people may reside “temporarily” in a different place for considerable periods. Thus a student who is attending law school in New York might for diversity purposes still be a citizen of Florida. In such cases, much may turn on intent, as demonstrated by external indicia. Consider, for example, <i>Hawkins v. Masters Farms</i>, supra page 7. Notice that the factual issues involved in such determinations can require significant inquiry at the outset of the lawsuit, inquiry unrelated to the merits of the case. Does this make the relatively mindless simplicity of the well-pleaded complaint rule look better by comparison?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c094ae43-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice the “neutral forum” justification for diversity lurking in the background of <i>Redner</i>: If the original congressional intent lay in the concern that courts of one state might discriminate against the citizens of another—then Redner’s residence in France “de-statified” him, and thus eliminated concern that New York courts would discriminate against a Californian (though they may still discriminate against someone from France).</p></li>

Commencement of the action occurs at the time the complaint is filed. When plaintiff filed his complaint here, he was a citizen of Oklahoma. Defendant does not contend otherwise.

Indeed, defendant’s argument that plaintiff is attempting to gain a “tactical advantage” rings entirely hollow because defendant’s argument for lack of jurisdiction appears to be nothing more than an attempt to gain his own tactical advantage—a return to state court. . . . </p>

For example, a party wishing to invoke diversity jurisdiction cannot achieve it simply by assigning his claim to an out-of-state representative. But the courts are not unanimous in what is “improper.” The statute resolves one situation: For diversity purposes the representative of a child, an incompetent, or a deceased person (appointed to administer the estate) has the same citizenship as the individual represented. 28 U.S.C. §1332(c)(2). You saw this principle in operation in <i>Hawkins v. Masters Farms</i> (Chapter 1), in which the relevant citizenship was not that of the executor but of the deceased, Mr. Creal.</p></li>

Section 1332(c) provides that, unlike natural persons, corporations can have <i>two</i> states of citizenship—that of the state that incorporates them and that of their “principal place of business,” if it is different from the state of incorporation. Congress added this provision in 1958 to remedy complaints that too many “home” corporations were able to invoke diversity citizenship by incorporating out of state. For decades thereafter courts struggled with inconsistent tests about how to define the corporation’s “principal place of business.” After half a century of disagreement, the Supreme Court stepped in to settle the matter.</p></li>

<p id="c094fc88-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal diversity jurisdiction statute provides that “a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated <i>and of the State where it has its principal place of business.</i>” 28 U.S.C. §1332(c)(1) (emphasis added). We seek here to resolve different interpretations that the Circuits have given this phrase. In doing so, we place primary weight upon the need for judicial <span title="226" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-226">p. 226</span>administration of a jurisdictional statute to remain as simple as possible. And we conclude that the phrase “principal place of business” refers to the place where the corporation’s high level officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation’s activities. Lower federal courts have often metaphorically called that place the corporation’s “nerve center.” We believe that the “nerve center” will typically be found at a corporation’s headquarters. . . . </p>
<p id="c094fc89-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The case grew from a class action. Hertz employees in California alleged that Hertz had failed to conform to California’s wage and hour laws. Hertz sought to remove to federal court, invoking diversity jurisdiction. The employees resisted with the argument that California was a principal place of business for Hertz, since it derived more revenue from that state than any other and the plurality of its business activities also occurred there. Reasoning that, because of this business activity Hertz was, like them, a citizen of California, the plaintiffs resisted removal. The District Court found that Hertz was a citizen of California, relying on Ninth Circuit precedent instructing “courts to identify a corporation’s ’principal place of business’ by first determining the amount of a corporation’s business activity State by State. If the amount of activity is ’significantly larger’ or ’substantially predominates’ in one State, then that State is the corporation’s ’principal place of business.’” The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court reviewed the history of “principal place of business” and its judicial interpretations.]</p>

<p id="c095239c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In an effort to find a single, more uniform interpretation of the statutory phrase, we have reviewed the Courts of Appeals’ divergent and increasingly complex interpretations. Having done so, we now return to, and expand, Judge Weinfeld’s approach, as applied [in a case decided shortly after the 1958 amendment to §1332 created dual corporate citizenship]. We conclude that “principal place of business” is best read as referring to the place where a corporation’s officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation’s activities. It is the place that Courts of Appeals have called the corporation’s “nerve center.” And in practice it should normally be the place where the corporation maintains its headquarters—provided that the headquarters is the actual center of direction, control, and coordination, <i>i.e.</i>, the “nerve center,” and not simply an office where the corporation holds its board meetings (for example, attended by directors and officers who have traveled there for the occasion).</p>
<p id="c095239d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three sets of considerations, taken together, convince us that this approach, while imperfect, is superior to other possibilities. First, the statute’s language supports the approach. The statute’s text deems a corporation a citizen of the “State where it has its principal place of business.” 28 U.S.C. §1332(c)(1). The word “place” is in the singular, not the plural. . . . </p>
<p id="c095239e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in a jurisdictional statute. Complex jurisdictional tests complicate a case, eating up time and money as the parties litigate, not the merits of their claims, but which court is the right court <span title="227" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-227">p. 227</span>to decide those claims. Complex tests produce appeals and reversals, encourage gamesmanship, and, again, diminish the likelihood that results and settlements will reflect a claim’s legal and factual merits. Judicial resources too are at stake. Courts have an independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even when no party challenges it. So courts benefit from straightforward rules under which they can readily assure themselves of their power to hear a case.</p>
<p id="c095239f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the statute’s legislative history, for those who accept it, offers a simplicity-related interpretive benchmark. The Judicial Conference provided an initial version of its proposal that suggested a numerical test. A corporation would be deemed a citizen of the State that accounted for more than half of its gross income. The Conference changed its mind in light of criticism that such a test would prove too complex and impractical to apply. That history suggests that the words “principal place of business” should be interpreted to be no more complex than the initial “half of gross income” test. A “nerve center” test offers such a possibility. A general business activities test does not.</p>

<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">

<p id="c09523a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize that there may be no perfect test that satisfies all administrative and purposive criteria. We recognize as well that, under the “nerve center” test we adopt today, there will be hard cases. For example, in this era of telecommuting, some corporations may divide their command and coordinating functions among officers who work at several different locations, perhaps communicating over the Internet. That said, our test nonetheless points courts in a single direction, towards the center of overall direction, control, and coordination. Courts do not have to try to weigh corporate functions, assets, or revenues different in kind, one from the other. Our approach provides a sensible test that is relatively easier to apply, not a test that will, in all instances, automatically generate a result.</p>
<p id="c09523a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We also recognize that the use of a “nerve center” test may in some cases produce results that seem to cut against the basic rationale for 28 U.S.C. §1332. For example, if the bulk of a company’s business activities visible to the public take place in New Jersey, while its top officers direct those activities just across the river in New York, the “principal place of business” is New York. One could argue that members of the public in New Jersey would be <i>less</i> likely to be prejudiced against the corporation than persons in New York—yet the corporation will still be entitled to remove a New Jersey state case to federal court. And note too that the same corporation would be unable to remove a New York state case to federal court, despite the New York public’s presumed prejudice against the corporation.</p>
<p id="c09523a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We understand that such seeming anomalies will arise. However, in view of the necessity of having a clearer rule, we must accept them. Accepting occasionally counterintuitive results is the price the legal system must pay to avoid overly complex jurisdictional administration while producing the benefits that accompany a more uniform legal system. . . . </p>

(That is a leading theory of the basis for diversity jurisdiction, but there is as little historical basis for this theory as there is for any other.) But if that is the reason for diversity jurisdiction, does a test that ignores the likelihood of such prejudice (as the Court’s New York/New Jersey example illustrates) properly apply the statute?</p></li>

Coudert was a law firm based in New York City. Most of its partners were citizens of New York, but a few partners were U.S. citizens living in France and working at their Paris office. Defendants were U.S. and foreign citizens. Coudert filed in state court and defendants sought to remove. Held: case remanded to state court. “If we were dealing with the situation where a partnership had partners who were citizens of New York and citizens of France, there would be diversity jurisdiction under subdivision (3) of the statute. However our case is different. The status of the Coudert partners residing in France is that they are still citizens of the United States and are not citizens of France. If these partners were suing by themselves they would not fit within any of the categories referred to in the statute, since they are neither citizens of a state of the United States nor are they citizens or subjects of a foreign state. . . . It would appear to be a logical extension of the rules of law referred to above that the Coudert partnership is not a party who can sue in federal court under diversity jurisdiction.” Id. at 526-27.

<p id="c0954ac3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Besides diversity, §1332 requires an amount greater than $75,000 in controversy. Congress has from time to time increased this amount, most recently in 1997, from $50,000 to the present figure. Given modern understandings of inflation, one can imagine that Congress might “index” the amount in controversy, linking it to some widely accepted measure of inflation. (Congress has pegged post-judgment interest to the rate of widely traded government notes.) What are the arguments for—and against—such a move?</p>
<p id="c0954ac4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whatever the dollar figure, the courts have treated this requirement in much the same way as they have the issue of federal question jurisdiction—that is, they have by and large viewed the allegations of the pleading as all but controlling, rather than engaging in judicial guessing about the likelihood that the plaintiff would succeed in collecting as much as he had prayed for. The leading Supreme Court case, St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U.S. 283, 289 (1938), stated as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0954ac5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It must appear to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount to justify dismissal. The inability of plaintiff to recover an amount adequate to give the court jurisdiction does not show his bad faith or oust the jurisdiction. Nor does the fact that the complaint discloses the existence of a valid defense of the claim. But if, from the face of the pleadings, it is apparent, to a legal certainty, that the plaintiff cannot recover the amount claimed, or if, from the proofs, the court is satisfied to a <span title="230" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-230">p. 230</span>like certainty that the plaintiff never was entitled to recover that amount, and that his claim was therefore colorable for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction, the suit will be dismissed.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0954ac6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the courts’ trust in the pleadings is not boundless. Consider, for example, a plaintiff who brought a diversity action against a hotel, alleging its security personnel had assaulted him; the likely compensatory damages were small, but the plaintiff relied on a punitive damage count to lift him over the amount in controversy:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0954ac7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff has not provided “competent proof” to meet his burden of demonstrating the requisite amount in controversy. Instead, he argues that he satisfies the jurisdictional requirement because he is entitled to recovery of punitive damages that could result in a verdict in excess of $75,000.</p>

<p id="c0954acb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In another respect, the Supreme Court has suggested that the amount in controversy requirement differs from the requirement of complete diversity. The issue surfaced in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Servs., Inc., 545 U.S. 546 (2005). In <i>Allapattah</i> the Court had to decide whether to include within the supplemental jurisdiction granted by 28 U.S.C. §1367 (discussed infra at pages 232-35) claims held by parties who met the diversity requirement but for less than $75,000. Yes, said the court, in part because the amount in controversy requirement was less central to the idea of diversity jurisdiction:</p>

The Court. . . . has adhered to the complete diversity rule in light of the purpose of the diversity requirement, which is to provide a federal forum for important disputes where state courts might favor, or be perceived as favoring, home-state litigants.

The basic principle is to try to value the injunction, using one of several approaches: Determine the value of the injunction to the plaintiff; determine the cost to the defendant of complying; determine the cost or value to the party invoking federal jurisdiction (the plaintiff, if the action is brought in federal court, and the defendant, if the action was brought in state court and defendant is attempting to remove); and allow jurisdiction if any of the tests above yields a figure above $75,000. For a discussion of these approaches (and an application of the fourth), see McCarty v. Amoco Pipeline Co., 595 F.2d 389 (7th Cir. 1979).</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c09571e9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If one plaintiff has a claim in excess of the statutory amount and a second plaintiff has the same claim for less than the statutory amount, both against the same defendant, the first plaintiff can sue in federal court.

<li class=""><p id="c09571ee-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Counterclaims are treated differently, depending on their classification under Rule 13 as either compulsory or permissive. Basically, when a plaintiff’s claim exceeds $75,000 (the statutory amount), a compulsory counterclaim may be heard regardless of amount. A permissive counterclaim not arising from the same transaction or occurrence requires an independent jurisdictional basis. The law is unsettled, however, when plaintiff’s claim falls short of $75,000 but defendant’s counterclaim increases the amount in controversy to more than $75,000. See generally Wright, Federal Courts 217 (reporting “virtually no holdings” addressing the question).</p></li>

Gibbs</i> and §1367 espouse a principle that may look surprising at first glance. Its rationale emerges more clearly if one recalls that a central feature of the Federal Rules is the ease with which they permit joinder of claims. See, e.g., Rule 18(a). It would be logically possible, but awkward, to permit parties to join closely connected claims but then deny the federal courts power over claims that did not bring their own jurisdictional basis with them. In such situations, whichever court (state or federal) tried the related claim second would have to engage in elaborate analyses of which issues were precluded in the first lawsuit. Section 1367 allows some—but not all—of these related claims to come to federal court under the wing of supplemental jurisdiction.</p></li>

<p id="c095c035-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In her Amended Complaint, Skanes alleges that in April 2004, she consummated a mortgage transaction with Ameriquest. Shortly before the close of the transaction, Ameriquest ordered from co-defendant Homestead Appraisal of Rockford a property appraisal of Skanes’ future home. Homestead, through its agent Trevino [appraised the house at] $163,000. . . . </p>
<p id="c095c036-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="236" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-236">p. 236</span>Skanes alleges that the “true value” of her home was much less than the amount reflected in Trevino’s report. . . . The reason for this inflation, Skanes contends, was to increase the loan amount for which she could qualify and thereby increase Ameriquest’s potential profit. [When the adjustable rate reset, Skanes could not refinance.]</p>
<p id="c095c037-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Count I of the complaint alleged a claim against Ameriquest under the federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA), seeking both rescission of the mortgage and statutory damages.] In Count I, her TILA claim, Skanes further states that at the time of her closing, Ameriquest provided her with improper and misleading disclosures of her right to cancel her mortgage. Ameriquest’s disclosures, she alleges, triggered an extended right for her to later rescind her mortgage. [Counts II and III alleged state law fraud claims against all defendants.] In addition, Skanes requests that we enter a “judgment declaring what obligation, if any, plaintiff has toward each defendant [following rescission], <i>taking into account. . . . the inflated appraised value</i>” (emphasis added). . . . </p>

<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c095c039-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">A. §1367(a) Supplemental Jurisdiction</p></div>
<p id="c095c03a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">28 U.S.C. §1367 provides that in any action in which we already have jurisdiction over some federal claim, we also have supplemental jurisdiction over state claims “that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.. . . . A loose factual connection may be sufficient to confer supplemental jurisdiction, so long as those facts are both common and operative. To determine whether the federal and state law claims are connected by common and operative facts, “[c]ourts routinely compare the facts necessary to prove the elements of the federal claim with those necessary to the success of the state claim.” We also may ask “whether the state claims can be resolved or dismissed without affecting the federal claims.”</p>
<p id="c095c03b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, Skanes explicitly connected her federal and state claims, such that we cannot now conclude that her state claims could be dismissed or resolved without affecting her TILA claim. As set forth in the Amended Complaint, the facts underlying her state and federal claims combine to tell one story: Skanes did not fully know of her right to cancel her mortgage at its outset; because that mortgage was overstated, she paid too much during the life of her loan; and—also because of the overstatement—she has not been able to refinance the mortgage. Alleging a [federal] TILA disclosure violation, Skanes now wishes to void her allegedly overstated mortgage. In doing so, Skanes expressly links her TILA prayer for relief to her state claims. Skanes seeks a judgment voiding her mortgage and a judgment declaring what, if any, payment obligation exists after taking into account Skanes’ state law challenge to her home appraisal.</p>
<p id="c095c03c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find this connection operative: if we dismiss Counts II and III, we may be unable to grant the full measure of relief Skanes seeks in Count I: if she is entitled to rescission, and she is correct that her home value was over-appraised, then she may be (or may not be—we do not intend to decide that issue here) entitled to reduce the post-TILA judgment tender amount in light of the over-appraisal. Without a <span title="237" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-237">p. 237</span>determination of the over-appraisal issue, though, that offset would be unavailable. Because we cannot conclude that the resolution of one of her state claims will have no effect on the resolution on her federal claims, we cannot deny our supplemental jurisdiction here.</p>

<p id="c095c03e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if we find that we have supplemental jurisdiction over a plaintiff’s state law claims, 28 U.S.C. §1367[(c)] provides four instances in which we may choose not to exercise that jurisdiction: “(1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law; (2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction; (3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction; or (4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.”</p>
<p id="c095c03f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not perceive a problem with respect to factors (2) through (4): we cannot tell from the face of the Amended Complaint that Skanes’ inflated appraisal allegations “substantially predominate” over her TILA claims; we have not dismissed Skanes’ TILA claims; and Trevino has not highlighted any persuasive “exceptional circumstances” or “compelling reasons” for us to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. Nor are we persuaded that because the Michigan Mortgage Brokers, Lenders and Servicers Lending Act [a state statute] has not been specifically applied to appraisers or appraisal services, we will not be able to resolve Skanes’ claims through reference to existing precedent (which, by the time this case has concluded, could well include applications of the MMBLSLA to appraisers and appraisal services). Accordingly, we choose to exercise our discretion in favor of retaining jurisdiction over Counts II and III of the Amended Complaint. . . . </p>

<p id="c095e756-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In March 2005, Szendrey received a report from an external law firm that included information about possible ethical and/or legal violations committed by bank officials in relation to the accounting for the bulk purchase of mortgage loans from other financial institutions. Szendrey conducted an investigation into this issue, focusing on the possibility of whether the bank officials’ conduct amounted to a violation of law or the bank’s Code of Ethics. Upon conclusion of such investigation, Szendrey concluded that there had been irregularities and violations of the Code of Ethics and reported such findings to outside counsel for the bank as well as bank officials. She also divulged her findings to the Board of Directors at a meeting in which she was present. . . . </p>

<p id="c095e759-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon careful consideration of the issues presented by this case, and the law governing such issues, we decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the P.R. law claims. Accordingly, these claims will be dismissed without prejudice, and Defendants’ arguments for dismissal on the merits of such claims are thus moot. As for the Title VII discrimination and retaliation claims, they survive the motion to dismiss. This case thus goes forward solely under Title VII. We explain our reasoning below. . . . </p>
<p id="c095e75a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court finds that two of §1367(c)’s subsections are at issue here: (1) that the state law claims raise complex or novel issues and (2) that the state-law claims substantially predominate over the federal claim. We start with the latter and work our way back to the former.</p>
<p id="c095e75b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs’ complaint includes two lonesome claims under Title VII, for discrimination and retaliation thereunder. The remaining claims all arise out of P.R. law. Not only do the P.R. law claims far outnumber the federal claims, but their scope also exceeds that of the federal claims. On that point we note that although some of the P.R. law claims mimic the federal claims. . . . the remaining P.R. law claims (wrongful discharge, tortious actions infringing Plaintiff’s constitutional rights, tortious interference with contracts, and defamation) are distinct and each has its own elements of proof; proof that is not necessary to establish the Title VII claims. That the state-law claims predominate over the federal claims is, in and of itself, reason enough to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="c095e75c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, we note that the P.R. law claims require a much fuller incursion into the performance of Szendrey as General Counsel and any shortcomings she may have had as such. This, in turn, leads us to the other reason for declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction: the presence of complex or novel issues of state law. The main issue raised by Defendants in their motion to dismiss, that Plaintiffs’ prosecution of their claims would run afoul of Canon 21 of the Puerto Rico Code of Professional Ethics, is at its apex in the P.R. law claims. For example, in order to prove that Defendants defamed her, Szendrey would have to establish that what was said about her (i.e., that she participated in wrongful acts) was false. In order to prove such falsity, Szendrey would have to reveal the extent of her participation regarding such wrongful acts, including what information she became aware of as General Counsel, what actions she took after learning such information, and what advice she offered her client with regards to such information. [Defendants argued that Canon 21 of Puerto Rican legal ethics rules forbade a lawyer from disclosing client confidences, even in litigation between lawyer and client.]</p>
<p id="c095e75d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Canon 21 undisputably belongs to an exclusively Puerto Rican body of law, and one that deals with the highly sensitive matter of lawyers’ conduct, and its relation to society’s interest in a fully functioning legal system. The interpretation of the canons <span title="239" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-239">p. 239</span>is normally the province of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, which is entrusted with the regulation and supervision of the legal profession. We note, moreover, that Canon 21 is decidedly different to the corresponding Model Rule of the American Bar Association. Unlike this Court and several U.S. jurisdictions, Puerto Rico has not adopted the latest version of the American Bar Association’s Model Rules.</p>
<p id="c095e75e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Canon 21 is decidedly silent on the issue of a lawyer’s claim—whether in-house or not—against his former client, and the possibility of divulging confidential information in order to pursue such a claim. . . . This is an issue of Puerto Rico law that has yet to be addressed by the Puerto Rico courts and which is imbued with important considerations of public policy. . . . </p>
<p id="c0960e6f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the Puerto Rico law claims substantially predominate over the federal claims in this case, and because they posit novel and complex issues of state law, the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Puerto Rico law claims will be dismissed without prejudice, so that Plaintiffs may re-file them in the Puerto Rico courts. . . . </p>

Even if the federal and state claims in this action arise out of the same factual situation, litigating these claims together may not serve judicial economy or trial convenience. Federal and state law each have a different focus, and the two bodies of law have evolved at different times and in different legislative and judicial systems. Because of this, in almost every case with supplemental state claims, the courts and counsel are unduly preoccupied with substantive and procedural problems in reconciling the two bodies of law and providing a fair and meaningful proceeding.</p>

Congress has also given defendants the power to trump plaintiffs who choose a state court in cases that could have been brought in federal court.

<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0965cb0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff, a citizen of Pennsylvania, files a complaint in Pennsylvania state court alleging state law violations, naming Danielle as defendant and seeking $100,000 in damages. Danielle is a citizen of Georgia. If Danielle wishes to remove, what must her notice of removal say?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0965cb1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If in her notice of removal Danielle falsely states that she is a citizen of Georgia, what risks does she run?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0965cb3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Same problem as in 2a, except that plaintiff’s initial complaint seeks only $10,000 in damages. Six months later, after some discovery, plaintiff amends his state complaint to add an additional cause of action, so he now seeks $85,000 in damages. May Danielle now remove?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0965cb4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Same problem as in 2a. Defendant removes, invoking diversity. What if plaintiff seeks remand to state court, offering to stipulate that she would seek less than $75,000 in damages? The Sixth Circuit, in Rogers v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., 230 F.3d 868 (6th Cir. 2000), affirmed a denial of the remand motion, saying that the propriety of removal should be judged by the apparent amount in controversy at the time removal is sought.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0965cb5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="242" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-242">p. 242</span>Plaintiff’s complaint seeks $10,000 in damages.

See <i>Troupe</i>, in Chapter 5 (page 300), for an illustration of this problem.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0965cb6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Same problem as in 2d, except that plaintiff amends his complaint more than a year after the original complaint. What obstacle to removal does §1446(c) pose?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09682c7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As in 2g, the complaint when first filed alleges less than the amount in controversy and the notice of removal is made over a year after the complaint is filed.

<p id="c09682d2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress, while unwilling to repeal diversity jurisdiction, has restricted it in a number of small ways.</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="c09682d3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has retained and occasionally increased the amount in controversy requirement.</p></li>

</ul>
<p id="c09682d7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These restrictions reflect a low-level continuing debate about the contemporary <span title="243" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-243">p. 243</span>usefulness of diversity jurisdiction. Most observers do not think that discrimination based on state citizenship (as opposed to other characteristics) plays a major role in the United States today. <i>If</i> the only reason for diversity jurisdiction were to guard against such discrimination, then one could challenge its contemporary role.</p>
<p id="c09682d8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defenses of diversity jurisdiction take several forms. Some argue that by providing “competition” for state courts, federal diversity cases raise the standards of some state judiciaries. Others argue that by providing a stream of “ordinary” cases (auto accidents, contract disputes), diversity cases prevent federal judges from becoming narrow specialists. Still others argue a variation on traditional justifications for diversity: Even if bias against out-of-staters is not strong, in many regions there <i>is</i> a bias in favor of “the home team” and that diversity jurisdiction prevents that type of bias from distorting litigation outcomes.</p>

<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c09682da-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Take, for example, The Formula Inc. v. Mammoth 8050 LLC, 2008 WL 60428 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 3, 2008). Formula filed its complaint in state court in Florida, and served a Summons and Complaint on Mammoth on October 23, 2007. On November 26, 2007, Mammoth removed the case to federal court based on diversity of citizenship. The district court remanded the case to state court on the ground that the removal was untimely.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c09682db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mammoth erroneously calculated the thirty day time frame so as not to include November 23, 2007 (believing that the Court was closed the day after Thanksgiving) and failed to file a notice of removal until November 26, 2007. Technically, November 23rd is not a legal holiday, as defined for instance in Federal Rule 6(a)(4)—only Thanksgiving Day itself is a legal holiday. Admittedly, the day after Thanksgiving is, for all practical purposes, a day in which many people do not go to work to kickoff the holiday buying-spree season (i.e., Black Friday). It is thus understandable that one may treat that day as a continuation of the Thanksgiving holiday. But no Federal statute, Court Rule, or Court Order deems that Friday as a holiday per se. . . . Mammoth concedes this fact but argues that, under the circumstances, there is good cause to excuse this technical one-day delay. The Court, however, is duty bound to strictly apply and enforce section 1446(b) that is an express statutory requirement for removal. The statute was drafted in mandatory language ("shall be filed within thirty days") and, thus, the failure to comply with the statute “can fairly be said to render the removal ’defective’ and justify a remand pursuant to Section 1447(c).”</p>

<li class=""><p id="c096a9ec-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Or consider Schafer v. Bayer Cropscience LP, 2010 WL 1038518 (E.D. Ark. Mar. 19, 2010). The initial complaint, alleging state law claims, was filed in state court on August 29, 2006.

Bayer removed the case on September 17, 2009, but the case was remanded to state court. After the state court severed nondiverse plaintiffs from the case, Bayer again removed the case to federal court on March 16, 2010. This time, the district court remanded the case to state court on the ground that the removal was untimely because it occurred more than one year after the case was first filed. The court acknowledged that Bayer was not a defendant in the case until more than one year after it had been filed.</p>

<p id="c096a9f4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question presented is whether the absence of complete diversity at the time of removal is fatal to federal-court adjudication. We hold that a district court’s error in failing to remand a case improperly removed is not fatal to the ensuing adjudication if federal jurisdictional requirements are met at the time judgment is entered.</p>
<p id="c096a9f5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent James David Lewis, a resident of Kentucky, filed this lawsuit in Kentucky state court on June 22, 1989, after sustaining injuries while operating a bulldozer. Asserting state-law claims based on defective manufacture, negligent maintenance, failure to warn, and breach of warranty, Lewis named as defendants both the manufacturer of the bulldozer—petitioner Caterpillar Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Illinois—and the company that serviced the bulldozer—Whayne Supply Company, a Kentucky corporation with its principal place of business in Kentucky.</p>
<p id="c096a9f6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several months later, Liberty Mutual Insurance Group, the insurance carrier for Lewis’ employer, intervened in the lawsuit as a plaintiff. A Massachusetts corporation with its principal place of business in that State, Liberty Mutual asserted subrogation claims against both Caterpillar and Whayne Supply for workers’ compensation benefits Liberty Mutual had paid to Lewis on behalf of his employer.</p>

Shortly after learning of this agreement, Caterpillar filed a notice of removal, on June 21, 1990, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. Grounding federal jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship, Caterpillar satisfied with only a day to spare the statutory requirement that a diversity-based removal take place within one year of a lawsuit’s commencement, see 28 U.S.C. §1446(b).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10AE9_d543b177-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10AE9_d543b177-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*1</a></span> Caterpillar’s notice of removal explained that the case was nonremovable at the lawsuit’s start: Complete diversity was absent then because plaintiff Lewis and defendant Whayne Supply shared Kentucky citizenship. Proceeding on the understanding that the settlement agreement between these two Kentucky parties would result in the dismissal of Whayne Supply from the lawsuit, Caterpillar stated that the settlement rendered the case removable.</p>
<p id="c096d109-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lewis objected to the removal and moved to remand the case to state court. Lewis acknowledged that he had settled his own claims against Whayne Supply. But Liberty Mutual had not yet settled its subrogation claim against Whayne Supply, Lewis asserted. Whayne Supply’s presence as a defendant in the lawsuit, Lewis urged, defeated diversity of citizenship. Without addressing this argument, the District Court denied Lewis’ motion to remand on September 24, 1990, treating as dispositive Lewis’ admission that he had settled his own claims against Whayne Supply.</p>
<p id="c096d10a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In June 1993, [Liberty Mutual and Whayne settled]. . . . With Caterpillar as the sole defendant adverse to Lewis, the case proceeded to a 6-day jury trial in November 1993, ending in a unanimous verdict for Caterpillar. . . . </p>
<p id="c096d10b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We note, initially, two “givens” in this case as we have accepted it for review. First, the District Court, in its decision denying Lewis’ timely motion to remand, incorrectly treated Whayne Supply, the nondiverse defendant, as effectively dropped from the case prior to removal. Second, the Sixth Circuit correctly determined that the complete diversity requirement was not satisfied at the time of removal. We accordingly home in on this question: Does the District Court’s initial misjudgment still burden and run with the case, or is it overcome by the eventual dismissal of the nondiverse defendant? . . . </p>
<p id="c096d10c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having preserved his objection to an improper removal, Lewis urges that an “all’s well that ends well” approach is inappropriate here. He maintains that ultimate satisfaction of the subject-matter jurisdiction requirement ought not swallow up antecedent statutory violations. The course Caterpillar advocates, Lewis observes, would disfavor diligent plaintiffs who timely, but unsuccessfully, move to check improper removals in district court. Further, that course would allow improperly removing defendants to profit from their disregard of Congress’ instructions, and their ability to lead district judges into error.</p>
<p id="c096d10d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Concretely, in this very case, Lewis emphasizes, adherence to the rules Congress prescribed for removal would have kept the case in state court. Only by removing prematurely was Caterpillar able to get to federal court inside the 1-year limitation set in §1446(b). Had Caterpillar waited until the case was ripe for removal, i.e., until Whayne Supply was dismissed as a defendant, the 1-year limitation would have barred the way, and plaintiff’s choice of forum would have been preserved.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B0A_d543b177-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10B0A_d543b177-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">14</a></span> These <span title="246" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-246">p. 246</span>arguments are hardly meritless, but they run up against an overriding consideration. Once a diversity case has been tried in federal court, with rules of decision supplied by state law under the regime of <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</i> [infra page 259] considerations of finality, efficiency, and economy become overwhelming. . . . </p>
<p id="c096d10f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our view is in harmony with a main theme of the removal scheme Congress devised. Congress ordered a procedure calling for expeditious superintendence by district courts. The lawmakers specified a short time, 30 days, for motions to remand for defects in removal procedure, 28 U.S.C. §1447(c), and district court orders remanding cases to state courts generally are “not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,” §1447(d). Congress did not similarly exclude appellate review of refusals to remand. But an evident concern that may explain the lack of symmetry relates to the federal courts’ subject-matter jurisdiction. Despite a federal trial court’s threshold denial of a motion to remand, if, at the end of the day and case, a jurisdictional defect remains uncured, the judgment must be vacated. See Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(h)(3) (“Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.”) In this case, however, no jurisdictional defect lingered through judgment in the District Court. To wipe out the adjudication postjudgment, and return to state court a case now satisfying all federal jurisdictional requirements, would impose an exorbitant cost on our dual court system, a cost incompatible with the fair and unprotracted administration of justice. Lewis ultimately argues that, if the final judgment against him is allowed to stand, “all of the various procedural requirements for removal will become unenforceable”; therefore, “defendants will have an enormous incentive to attempt wrongful removals.” In particular, Lewis suggests that defendants will remove prematurely “in the hope that some subsequent developments, such as the eventual dismissal of nondiverse defendants, will permit the case to be kept in federal court.” We do not anticipate the dire consequences Lewis forecasts.</p>
<p id="c096d110-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The procedural requirements for removal remain enforceable by the federal trial court judges to whom those requirements are directly addressed. Lewis’ prediction. . . . rests on an assumption we do not indulge—that district courts generally will not comprehend, or will balk at applying, the rules on removal Congress has prescribed. The prediction furthermore assumes defendants’ readiness to gamble that any jurisdictional defect, for example, the absence of complete diversity, will first escape detection, then disappear prior to judgment. The well-advised defendant, we are satisfied, will foresee the likely outcome of an unwarranted removal—a swift and nonreviewable remand order, see 28 U.S.C. §1447(c), (d), attended by the displeasure of a district court whose authority has been improperly invoked. The odds against any gain from a wrongful removal, in sum, render improbable Lewis’ projection of increased resort to the maneuver.</p>

<p id="c096f828-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Ginsburg, whose Supreme Court nomination was confirmed in 1993, had two careers before assuming her present position, both of which mark her pioneering role as a woman in the legal profession.</p>
<p id="c096f829-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having earned a distinguished record both at Harvard and Columbia Law Schools, Ginsburg found herself highly recommended as a clerk to Justice Felix Frankfurter of the Supreme Court by the dean of Harvard Law School. Frankfurter reportedly turned her down because she was a woman—a practice in which Frankfurter was then not alone among his fellow Justices. Nor, in spite of having been first in her law school class, was she offered a job by any of the 12 New York law firms with whom she interviewed. A similar pattern marked her entry into academia. Initially appointed as a research associate at Columbia Law School, she taught at Rutgers-Newark for ten years before accepting an appointment in 1972 as the first tenured woman in the history of Columbia Law School. Her academic specialties included comparative civil procedure and conflicts of law.</p>
<p id="c096f82a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While teaching, Ginsburg co-founded the Women’s Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union and briefed and argued before the U.S. Supreme Court several pioneering gender discrimination cases. Press accounts credit her with a strategy of small, incremental steps and choosing unthreatening lead plaintiffs—frequently men—in her cases. One account described her strategy as “not expect[ing] to force social change; she wanted [instead] to ’give it a green light’ in her words, and she moved the Justices to send that signal through a series of simple, scarcely controversial cases.”</p>

See §1446(c). Notice that in some cases this time limit allows plaintiffs an opportunity to manipulate jurisdiction, joining nondiverse parties and then dropping them after a year. But note as well that 28 U.S.C. §1446(c)(1) allows removal even after a year if the plaintiff has acted in “bad faith” to block removal.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c096f832-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ohio sought to discourage removal by enacting a statute providing that any out-of-state insurer that removed a case to federal court was barred from doing business in the state for three years.

<li class=""><p id="c0971f43-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Capron v. Van Noorden</i>, supra page 217, the plaintiff sued defendant in federal court and lost. On appeal in the Supreme Court, plaintiff argued there was no subject matter jurisdiction over the case because of lack of diversity. The Supreme Court dismissed the case—so the plaintiff won by challenging the very jurisdiction he had invoked! Contrast <i>Caterpillar</i>, in which the plaintiff properly and accurately objected to removal. But the Court in <i>Caterpillar</i>, acknowledging that diversity did not exist at the time of removal, nevertheless affirmed the federal judgment. Can one distinguish the two cases?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0971f45-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, §1442 permits removal of suits by federal officers or agencies sued for the performance of their duties even when §1441 would not permit removal.

<li class=""><p id="c0971f46-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, whose minimal diversity provision we have already noted (supra page 224) contains a removal provision in 28 U.S.C. §1453 allowing some claims based entirely on state law and lacking complete diversity nevertheless to be removed to federal court.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0971f47-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA) (15 U.S.C. §77p(b)) takes matters one step further—and takes us back to <i>Mottley</i>, which began this chapter. First, SLUSA (how’s that for an attractive acronym?) preempts state securities class actions alleging fraud in the sales of securities. It provides, in other words, that in such cases federal law displaces otherwise applicable state law. Second, it provides that securities fraud class actions based entirely on state law “shall be removable to the federal district court for the district in which the action is pending.” 15 U.S.C. §77p(c). Finally, it orders dismissal of the removed class actions. This three-step process provides a review of much of this chapter. Congress has essentially created a federal defense to state law securities class actions. Think back to <i>Mottley</i>, in which a federal defense to a state law claim did not create “arising under” jurisdiction. Congress might have left things there, relying on the state courts and occasional Supreme Court review to enforce this scheme. But SLUSA goes beyond that, using removal jurisdiction to assure that its substantive preemption of state law will be systematically enforced. In this specific category of cases SLUSA creates exactly what <i>Mottley</i> rejected: federal jurisdiction, here removal jurisdiction, based on a federal defense to a state law claim.</p></li>

As a final reminder of the extent to which federal jurisdiction is a creature of statute, consider 28 U.S.C. §1445. It forbids removal of some actions—among them workers’ compensation claims and suits brought under the federal Violence Against Women Act—that otherwise would be removable under §1441. Examine that statute and consider why Congress might have made such actions nonremovable and thus allowed plaintiffs to dictate the choice between state and federal court.</p></li>

<p id="c0971f4a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jurisdictional reach of U.S. federal courts has played an important and often controversial role in the nation’s history. Over the past two centuries these courts, sometimes denounced as protectors of powerful national corporations, sometimes denounced and simultaneously hailed as vindicators of racial justice and the rights of women, have also played a homelier role in everyday disputes, ranging from the claim of a worker to his wages to claims arising from auto accidents involving out-of-state tourists. The overlapping jurisdictions of the state and federal courts also figure in lawyers’ strategy, as they maneuver to gain (or avoid) a forum with characteristics that often differ from those of the state courts.</p>
<p id="c0971f4b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not too long ago, those federal courts also represented an escape from state law, even on claims based on state law. How that happened, how that era ended, and the continuing issues its end created form the subject of the next chapter.</p>

D is correct <span title="252" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-252">p. 252</span>because the Supreme Court, as in <i>Mottley</i>, has jurisdiction to hear and decide any question of federal law, not just claims that arise under federal law.</p>
<p id="c09794a9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q2.</b> B is the only correct response. A is wrong because the diversity statute requires <i>both</i> diversity and the stated amount in controversy. C is wrong because a resident of the forum state cannot remove if the only basis for jurisdiction is diversity—as is the case here. D is wrong because the “except” clause of §1332(a)(2) treats lawful permanent residents as citizens of the state where they reside, and so plaintiff and defendant are not diverse.</p>
<p id="c09794aa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q3.</b> B and C are correct responses. A is wrong because an injunction may be “valued,” and diversity jurisdiction will lie if that value exceeds $75,000. D is wrong because diversity is measured from the date on which suit is filed; a later move is irrelevant. B is correct (but sneaky) because the statute requires that the amount in controversy <i>exceed</i> $75,000. C is correct because the presence of a New York party on both sides of the suit violates the complete diversity rule.</p>
<p id="c09794ab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4.</b> A and C are correct. A is correct because there is no diversity and the claim (as opposed to the defense) does not arise under federal law. B is wrong because the lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction is not waived (Rule 12(h)(3)). C is correct (12(h)(3)). D is wrong because several cases have held that even a party who invoked the court’s subject matter jurisdiction can thereafter challenge it. <i>Capron v. Van Noorden</i>, supra page 217.</p>
<p id="c09794ac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q5.</b> C and D are the correct responses. A is wrong because removal is possible only if there would have been original jurisdiction; here there is no federal claim and no diversity—thus no removal. B is wrong because, although there is diversity, a home-state defendant cannot remove. C is correct because the antitrust claim is federal, and thus removable. D is correct because both diversity and the amount in controversy requirements are met and the out-of-state defendant seeks to remove.</p>
<p id="c09794ad-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="253" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-253">p. 253</span><b>Q6.</b> A, B, C, and D are all correct responses. A is correct because federal law creates Abe’s claim. B is correct because there’s no diversity and the state claim, by definition, does not arise under federal law. C is correct because it’s a claim arising from the same facts as the federal claim. D is correct because §1367(a) so provides.</p>
<p id="c09794ae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q7.</b> Only A and B are correct. For A and B see the preceding question. C is wrong because, unlike the preceding question, the state law claim arises from a different set of facts and invokes a distinct body of law. D is wrong: <i>Because</i> there’s no linkage between the two claims, they do not arise out of the same constitutional case or controversy as required in §1367(a).</p>
<p id="c09794af-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q8.</b> A, B, C, and D are all correct responses. A is correct because there’s diversity jurisdiction. B is correct because the claim against Catherine does not arise under federal law and there’s no diversity. C is correct because this dispute apparently involves both the employer (who has lost Ben as an employee) and the lurer-away (Catherine), whose actions induced Ben to breach the contract. D is correct because even though the claim against Catherine involves the same constitutional case or controversy, 28 U.S.C. §1367(b) does not permit supplemental jurisdiction to extend to claims by plaintiffs against nondiverse parties joined under Rule 20 when the only basis for jurisdiction is diversity.</p>
