What they might mean and whether they are right will provide the focus of this chapter. Applied to contemporary U.S. litigation, the quoted statement can refer to the parties’ failure to settle or otherwise resolve their dispute outside the formal litigation processes. Alternatively, it can refer to a failure to resolve the case through procedural mechanisms that are part of the formal litigation process.</p>
<p id="c0d2061a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The last few decades have seen renewed interest in resolving disputes outside the litigation process. Such approaches—including arbitration and mediation—have grown in number and interest in them has intensified. The world of private dispute resolution, which some say is replacing ordinary litigation, presents both the best and worst of human creativity. Those who see promise in these alternative systems contend that arbitration and mediation allow parties to resolve disputes economically and imaginatively: We’ll see some examples in this chapter. Those who see danger in these alternative systems point to evidence of one-sidedness, greed, and disregard for basic fairness, examples of which we will also see in this chapter.</p>
<p id="c0d2061b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some parties do not pursue private dispute resolution and cannot agree on a settlement. What then? A hundred and fifty years ago, the answer was clear: trial. But trials are expensive; even a short trial will cost thousands of dollars in lawyers’, witnesses’, and jurors’ fees, and judicial time—not to mention the time and <span title="524" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-524">p. 524</span>emotional toll on the parties. The Federal Rules offer additional opportunities for cases to resolve short of trial in an apparent effort to avoid some of these costs. You have already explored one of these opportunities: Rule 12 motions, which can end a case before the defendant even answers the complaint. In this chapter we consider others, including summary judgment (which allows a court to dismiss a case following discovery).</p>
<p id="c0d2061c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Procedural changes in the last century have accompanied a substantial decline in the frequency of trials. In the last 75 years, the civil trial rate in the federal courts has fallen from about 20 percent to just less than 2 percent. Figures for the state courts, which handle about 98 percent of civil litigation, are comparable. There is a debate about whether those who designed the new procedures intended this reduction in trials and, whether or not they did, if it is a bad thing.</p>

<p id="c0d22d30-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why do lawsuits ever proceed beyond the complaint? Defendants accused of wrongdoing might just ignore the allegations if there were no way of forcing a response. Conversely, plaintiffs might file meritless suits that would hang over defendants’ heads indefinitely were there not some way of forcing them to a conclusion. Both possibilities are inherent in a system that assigns to the parties rather than the court primary responsibility for the progress of litigation. Two procedural devices force the parties to engage and respond to each other: the default judgment, the threat of which should goad the defendant into action; and the involuntary dismissal, intended to keep the plaintiff from going to sleep at the litigative switch. Versions of such principles are found in Rule 55 (for default judgments) and Rule 41(b) (involuntary dismissal).</p>

<p id="c0d22d33-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How does Rule 55 goad the defendant into action? If a defendant has been properly served with a complaint and then fails to respond, the plaintiff can go to the court clerk with proof of the defendant’s delinquency, and the clerk will enter defendant’s default. Rule 55(a). Then, the plaintiff can submit proof of her injury to the clerk or court and receive a default judgment that she can use to seize defendant’s assets—wages, bank accounts, and real property. Rule 55(c).</p>
<p id="c0d22d34-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most defaults and default judgments involve creditors’ suits over unpaid consumer debts, and the vast majority are not challenged. If a defendant does not have a plausible defense or counterclaim, then the default judgment represents merely a shorter, cheaper route to the right result. If, however, a defendant has a viable defense but cannot find or afford a lawyer, or does not receive adequate notice <span title="525" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-525">p. 525</span>of the default, the entry of a default judgment represents a reproach to the legal system. No robust empirical studies tell us which possibility occurs more often.</p>
<p id="c0d22d35-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next case was originally brought in Texas state court—and so does not invoke the federal rules—but shows the Supreme Court balancing the efficiencies of default judgments against defendants’ due process protections.</p>

<p id="c0d22d3b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Heights Medical Center, Inc. (hereafter appellee) sued appellant Peralta in February 1982, to recover some $5600 allegedly due under appellant’s guarantee of a hospital debt incurred by one of his employees. Citation issued, the return showing personal, but untimely, service. Appellant did not appear or answer, and on July 20, 1982, default judgment was entered for the amount claimed, plus attorney’s fees and costs.</p>
<p id="c0d22d3c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In June 1984, appellant began a bill of review proceeding in the Texas courts to set aside the default judgment and obtain the relief. In the second amended petition, it was alleged that the return of service itself showed a defective service<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1008B_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1008B_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">2</a></span> and that appellant in fact had not been personally served at all. The judgment was therefore void under Texas law. It was also alleged that the judgment was abstracted and recorded in the county real property records, thereby creating a cloud on appellant’s title, that a writ of attachment was issued, and that, unbeknownst to him, his real property was sold to satisfy the judgment and for much less than its true value. Appellant prayed that the default judgment be vacated, the abstract of judgment be expunged from the county real property records, the constable’s sale be voided, and that judgment for damages be entered against the Medical Center and Mr. and Mrs. Paul Seng-Ngan Chen, the purchasers at the constable’s sale and appellees here.</p>
<p id="c0d2534e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that in a bill of review proceeding such as appellant filed, it must be shown that the petitioner had a meritorious defense to the action in which judgment had been entered, that petitioner was prevented from proving his defense by the fraud, accident, or wrongful act of the opposing party, and that there had been no fault or negligence on petitioner’s part. Although it was assumed for the purposes of summary judgment that there had been defective service and that this lapse excused proof of the second and third requirement for obtaining a bill of review, it was assertedly necessary, nevertheless, to show a meritorious defense, which appellant had conceded he did not have.</p>
<p id="c0d2534f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . “An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under the <span title="526" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-526">p. 526</span>circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them the opportunity to present their objections.” <i>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co</i>. [supra page 165]. Failure to give notice violates “the most rudimentary demands of due process of law.” Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 550 (1965). See also. . . . <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i> [supra page 68].</p>
<p id="c0d25350-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Texas courts nevertheless held, as appellee urged them to do, that to have the judgment set aside, appellant was required to show that he had a meritorious defense, apparently on the ground that without a defense, the same judgment would again be entered on retrial and hence appellant had suffered no harm from the judgment entered without notice. But this reasoning is untenable. As appellant asserts, had he had notice of the suit, he might have impleaded the employee whose debt had been guaranteed, worked out a settlement, or paid the debt. He would also have preferred to sell his property himself in order to raise funds rather than to suffer it sold at a constable’s auction.</p>
<p id="c0d25351-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor is there any doubt that the entry of the judgment itself had serious consequences. It is not denied that the judgment was entered on the county records, became a lien on appellant’s property, and was the basis for issuance of a writ of execution under which appellant’s property was promptly sold, without notice. Even if no execution sale had yet occurred, the lien encumbered the property and impaired appellant’s ability to mortgage or alienate it; and state procedures for creating and enforcing such liens are subject to the strictures of due process. Here, we assume that the judgment against him and the ensuing consequences occurred without notice to appellant, notice at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner that would have given him an opportunity to be heard. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d25352-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . The Texas court held that the default judgment must stand absent a showing of a meritorious defense to the action in which judgment was entered without proper notice to appellant, a judgment that had substantial adverse consequences to appellant. By reason of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, that holding is plainly infirm. Where a person has been deprived of property in a manner contrary to the most basic tenets of due process, “it is no answer to say that in his particular case due process of law would have led to the same result because he had no adequate defense upon the merits.” Coe v. Armour Fertilizer Works, 237 U.S. 413, 424 (1915). As we observed in <i>Armstrong v. Manzo</i>, only “wip[ing] the slate clean. . . . would have restored the petitioner to the position he would have occupied had due process of law been accorded to him in the first place.” The Due Process Clause demands no less in this case.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0d27a6d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This preference means that parties seeking relief from defaults and default judgments get them set aside if they can show good cause for failing to respond to the summons. See Rule 55(c).</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0d27a6f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Challenging are the cases in which the defendant is served and retains a lawyer—who then fails to respond to the complaint or to court orders. Theoretically, it would be easy to enter a default judgment and let the plaintiff sue his negligent lawyer for malpractice. In practice, courts don’t like that solution—in part because the same lawyers who fail to answer the complaint are unlikely to have bothered to buy malpractice insurance. Or, the problem can lie with the client rather than the lawyer. Consider Honda Power Equip. Mfg., Inc. v. Woodhouse, 219 F.R.D. 2 (D.D.C. 2003). The case arose from a patent dispute between Honda and Mr. Woodhouse, who claimed that some of Honda’s engines infringed his patent. Honda filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking a judgment of non-infringement. Woodhouse hired a lawyer, who acknowledged service of process and requested additional time <span title="528" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-528">p. 528</span>to answer. But Woodhouse then failed to respond to his counsel’s inquiries, and an answer was never filed. The court entered a default judgment, but only after writing a six-page opinion reciting defendant’s counsel’s repeated efforts to get a response from his client, the prejudice to Honda from the delay, and the fact that a UK court had found against Woodhouse in related patent litigation.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d27a70-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Honda’s willingness to grant Mr. Woodhouse an extension of time to answer in the preceding note is typical. Plaintiffs are often ready to grant such extensions, particularly if they think that defendant will use that time to decide whether to make a settlement offer.

He can move to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12; answer the complaint; or ignore the complaint altogether. Consider the financial implications of these three choices and the ways in which these choices implicate other aspects of procedure. If the defendant moves to dismiss the case, he will need to pay his lawyer to research and brief the motion, but could end up having the case dismissed in whole or part if the motion is successful. If the defendant answers the complaint, the answer itself may be relatively inexpensive but the case will proceed to discovery and summary judgment will offer the next likely opportunity for dismissal. Ignoring the complaint is free, but it will likely cause the court to enter a default judgment against him for the value of the plaintiff’s claims.</p>

Suppose the <i>Pennoyer</i> Court had taken the approach in <i>Peralta</i>. It could have set aside the default judgment without the need to invent the law of personal jurisdiction!</p>

<p id="c0d2a18d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Involuntary dismissal does to plaintiffs what default does to defendants: It forces them to pursue the lawsuit to some resolution. In our largest state’s court system these dismissals occur in about 5 percent of civil filings. Judicial Council of California, Court Statistics Report (2016), Table 5a, page 93. They sometimes result from plaintiffs realizing that their cases are weaker than previously thought, sometimes from realizing that litigation will be more expensive than thought.</p>
<p id="c0d2a18e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In an ordinary lawsuit, defendant has something that plaintiff wants and can get only if the lawsuit proceeds. One might therefore think that a defendant would be quite happy to face a plaintiff who, after filing and serving the complaint, did nothing. And often defendants are. But consider why a defendant might feel aggrieved if a plaintiff commenced but then did nothing to prosecute the suit for several years. Imagine a variation on the facts in <i>Peralta</i>: The plaintiff files the suit, serves the defendant, and puts a lien on his property, but instead of proceeding to a judgment the plaintiff simply sits and waits. Mr. Peralta can’t get the suit dismissed on the merits (recall he has no meritorious defense), but meanwhile he can’t sell the property or borrow money on it because of the lien.</p>
<p id="c0d2a18f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Add to your picture the role the judge plays in pretrial litigation. You will recall from the preceding chapter on discovery that the event triggering the exchange of disclosures is the “scheduling order.” Much of Rule 16 tells the judge what she “may” do, but Rule 16(b) says the judge ”<i>must</i> issue a scheduling order” (emphasis added) unless the case belongs to an exempt category. That scheduling order “must <span title="530" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-530">p. 530</span>limit the time to join other parties, amend the pleadings, complete discovery, and file motions” and “may” set other dates. Scheduling orders are supposed to drive the parties along the path to settlement or trial.</p>
<p id="c0d2a190-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lying behind scheduling orders is a fact that does not often get articulated in judicial opinions: Courts are very busy. In 2016 the federal courts saw about 292,000 civil and 76,000 new criminal cases filed. Congress has authorized 677 district court judgeships. If all those positions were filled, the average federal district judge would have 530 new cases each year for which she was responsible; in practice, there are always a number of unfilled positions, so actual caseloads run higher. Judges in state courts, where most litigation occurs, often have even larger caseloads; in 2008, judges in courts of general jurisdiction (where felonies and large-stake civil litigation occur) had caseloads averaging 2,950 per judge. That national average conceals wide variations, from Massachusetts with about 384 filings per judge to South Carolina, with about 4,842. National Center for State Courts, Examining the Work of State Courts 20 (2008). Such caseloads make for judges who are (a) busy, sometimes to the point of frazzled impatience; and (b) eager to manage their cases in such a way that the backlog does not grow.</p>
<p id="c0d2a191-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What can a defendant do if plaintiff ignores a scheduling order’s deadlines or fails to move the lawsuit forward? Rule 41(b) and similar state statutes provide for involuntary dismissal “if the plaintiff fails to prosecute” (as well as on other grounds). Such a dismissal takes the lawsuit off the books. The question is, how lax must a plaintiff be before a judge should enter such a dismissal? In other words, when does “standard” foot-dragging become abandonment? The answer to these questions will be highly context-specific. Consider, though, Caussade v. United States, 293 F.R.D. 625 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (involuntarily dismissing plaintiff’s claim against the United States for injuries at a post office because the plaintiff never made herself available for a deposition, never made initial disclosures, never corrected deficiencies in her responses to interrogatories, did not appear at a pretrial conference, and did not keep in contact with her attorney for months at a time).</p>

<p id="c0d2a194-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the basis of the exposition so far, one might assume that both plaintiff and defendant are locked in adversarial combat until a judge or jury enters judgment for one or the other. Not quite. Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i) allows a plaintiff to dismiss any time before the defendant answers, and Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(ii) permits the plaintiff to dismiss a suit at any time if all the parties agree. Why would they agree? Suppose the parties are close to settling and want more time without distractions like discovery in which to negotiate. Such stipulated dismissals do not bar a later refiling of the suit unless there has been a previous dismissal or the dismissal itself contains a provision that bars refiling. Provisions barring refiling frequently result from successful settlement negotiations: In return for money or other relief, the plaintiff gives up her chance to pursue the suit or to refile it later.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0d2c8a9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At common law, such dismissals made sense because they enabled a plaintiff who had a good claim but had brought the wrong writ to replead (e.g., to plead trespass instead of trespass on the case, assumpsit instead of debt). The justification for such false starts is much less clear in a system that permits easy joinder of claims and easy amendment. In such a system, one could easily justify a door that locked behind the plaintiff once she had begun a lawsuit: “Either pursue it to a judgment or settlement, or, if you abandon the suit, do so irrevocably.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d2c8aa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One possible reason is to give plaintiff a little breathing room to consider changed circumstances. Suppose software Inventor, having sued SoftWare Co. for infringement, learns that Inventor Two is about to sue <i>him</i> for infringement. Inventor may need some time to decide whether his suit should be dropped entirely, or, by contrast, whether he should now add Inventor Two as another defendant, perhaps bringing a more complex suit in a different jurisdiction.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d2c8ab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i) allows the plaintiff voluntarily to dismiss at any time before the defendant has answered; after that point the court’s permission or agreement of the other side is necessary. In one notorious case the availability of voluntary dismissal proved catastrophic for the defendant. In corporate control litigation between two giant oil companies, Texaco and Pennzoil—Texaco Inc. v. Pennzoil, 481 U.S. 1 (1987)—the plaintiff filed originally in a Delaware state court seeking a preliminary injunction. Defendant opposed the injunction but did not answer the complaint. When the court denied the request for a preliminary injunction, using language suggesting the plaintiff would eventually lose on the merits, the plaintiff quickly took a voluntary dismissal and refiled in Texas. A Texas jury eventually awarded the plaintiff $10 billion. Voluntary dismissal without court approval would have been unavailable had Texaco answered the Delaware complaint. The defendant’s failure to answer has been described as “one of the most expensive tactical errors ever committed in a lawsuit.” Timothy Feltham, <i>Tortious Interference with Contractual Relations: The</i> Texaco Inc. v. Pennzoil <i>Litigation</i>, 33 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 111, 117 n.65 (1988). If a voluntary dismissal will harm your client, answer the complaint promptly to lock plaintiff into the forum.</p></li>

If permission is required, courts routinely require plaintiffs to pay the defendant’s attorneys’ fees as a condition of granting the motion. The logic is fairly clear: Plaintiff chose the time and place of suit and has caused defendant at least the expense of retaining a lawyer and answering the complaint (recall that voluntary dismissals before an answer do not require leave of court). Now plaintiff has changed his mind, but remains free to sue again. Shouldn’t plaintiff have to pay the cost of this vacillation? Should the Rule make this condition explicit?</p>

<p id="c0d2c8af-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Faced with the products of discovery and kept in engagement by procedural rules, parties may decide that they want to avoid adjudication. Indeed, given foreknowledge about procedural rules, they may decide well before any dispute arises that they wish to avoid litigation. The contemporary U.S. legal regime offers parties a broad set of ways to escape litigation once it has begun or avoid litigation altogether.</p>
<div id="c0d2c8b0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0d2c8b1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">1.&nbsp;Negotiation and Settlement: Why Settle? And How?</p></h3></div>

<p id="c0d2c8b2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the beginning of recorded legal systems, parties have regularly settled most of their disputes informally, without adjudication. Behind this fact lies a normative question. Settlements are cheaper and faster than trials. Are they also better—or are they merely a capitulation to expediency? Some argue that settlements are not just faster and cheaper but also qualitatively better, because consent is a basic principle of justice, and because settlements can take account of nuances and subtleties in the facts and in the parties’ interests that would be lost in adjudication. On the other side are those who argue that settlement leaves the parties less satisfied than if a trier heard their stories, sometimes permits might to triumph over right, and deprives the public of definitive adjudication of issues that may reach beyond the individual case.</p>
<p id="c0d2c8b3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where one falls on this normative question may depend on the case and the reasons it settled. One reason for settlement is unattractive: What if a party simply runs out of funds to pursue the litigation? A settlement, getting something, may be better than getting nothing (which is what will happen if the case is dismissed) or being stuck with a default judgment (if the defendant is the side unable to pursue the case). How often does this happen? There’s evidence that cases collapsing without regard to the merits is a much rarer event than it used to be. As the materials in Chapter 5 suggest, modern litigation finance is relatively <span title="533" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-533">p. 533</span>creative, and the plaintiffs’ bar better capitalized; therefore the stock story of the meritorious plaintiff crushed by defendant’s vastly superior resources is less true today than it once was. Different dynamics apply to defendants. Defendants who cannot pay a judgment will rarely be sued for damages (hold-over tenants and divorce litigation are significant exceptions here), so when defendants abandon litigation, it will usually be because circumstances have changed since the case began.</p>
<p id="c0d2c8b4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That leaves a second, more common and thus more important, reason for settling. Settlements control risk. Trial outcomes have two characteristics that make them risky: (1) They are significantly unpredictable, and (2) they tend to be all-or-nothing. Even experienced lawyers have a hard time predicting how juries will decide a given case—keep in mind that summary judgment (infra page 569) will eliminate the clear cases, so the only cases that make it to trial should be those where the evidence doesn’t point clearly in one direction. Substantive law tells judge and jury not to split the difference, but either to hold the defendant liable for all proximately caused damages or to find for the defense. Consequently, trial can result in either a catastrophe or a windfall for both parties, and no one knows for certain which will happen. Exacerbating these risks is the fact that trial is expensive. Not only is lawyers’ time in trial expensive, but expert witnesses have to be paid, exhibits prepared, and witnesses’ memories refreshed (in most jurisdictions a trial will come at least a year after suit is filed, which may be several years after the events in question). Moreover, in spite of judicial efforts to have parties complete discovery well before trial, in many cases the approach of trial will set off a flurry of additional discovery as lawyers scurry to shore up weak points in their cases. Parties will also submit various pretrial motions to exclude evidence and the like, running expenses even higher. So, for many parties, settlement is appealing because it provides a way of avoiding an expensive and risky trial.</p>
<p id="c0d2c8b5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If they are to achieve their goals, whether of risk avoidance or of consensual justice, settlements have to be technically competent. Settlement agreements require both negotiating skill and knowledge of how parties can achieve their goals once they come to agreement in principle. Unlike parties who are negotiating the sale of a building or the terms of an employment agreement, parties who are negotiating in the shadow of litigation and trial are likely to be somewhat annoyed with each other. Lawyers can contribute to negotiations by interposing a professional role that keeps the disputants from each others’ throats long enough to work out an agreement. Or they can make things worse by becoming so personally embroiled with their counterparts that they prevent two clients, who might otherwise have agreed, from doing so! Whether they help or hinder agreement, however, lawyers can contribute expertise to the terms and the form of settlement, anticipating problems and preventing the settlement of one dispute from becoming the start of another.</p>

Litigation involves one set of such risks: What might be the outcome of this suit? Settlement controls risk. A plaintiff accepting a defendant’s settlement offer eliminates the risk of recovering nothing by giving up the possibility of a recovery at trial greater than the settlement amount. For the defendant the risks are reversed: By giving up the possibility of a defense judgment, defendant controls the risk of a verdict greater than the amount paid in settlement.</p></li>

They will ask you not just “what is the law here?” but also “what’s the likely outcome of this case?” They are, in effect, asking for your estimates of risk. That second question is very difficult to answer (and some data suggest that even experienced lawyers are not very accurate in making those estimates). But clients will expect answers, and part of a lawyer’s job is to understand the ways in which their client may rank different kinds of risk.</p></li>

Until recently she worked at GrowCo, a relatively new, profitable, and expanding firm specializing in genetically modified crops. GrowCo has been much in the news recently, with favorable press reports and significant investor interest. Smart has been deeply involved in developing some of GrowCo’s most successful crops. A dispute with the Senior Scientist, whom Smart accuses of sexual harassment, leads to her dismissal. Dr. Smart consults a lawyer and threatens to bring an action for unlawful discharge and employment discrimination, invoking state law and Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act. As the lawyers for both sides speak with their clients, the facts aren’t one-sided. Plaintiff’s story suggests that Senior Scientist has behaved in ways that are at least obnoxious (and will sound terrible to a jury) and are perhaps unlawful. But plaintiff’s story also has some problems. It’s not clear that she was an excellent employee before her dismissal, and her past involves some breaches of scientific ethics in testing genetically modified crops on humans that will make it easy for defendant to challenge her testimony and portray her as an untrustworthy person.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0d2efdf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Regardless of how they reach agreement, the parties generally do not need the court’s approval of their deal. In an ordinary case, the judge need not examine or approve the settlement, though he must grant—usually routinely—plaintiff’s request to dismiss the case if that is part of the deal. Plaintiffs needing immediate funds may settle meritorious claims for trivial sums; defendants eager to get on with other matters may offer substantial sums on meritless claims to end litigation. The principal exceptions to this “freedom to settle” arise in class actions (where Rule 23(e) requires judicial approval of settlements); in cases involving minors or incompetent adults, where the court is required to approve settlements; and in some multi-defendant cases. What theory underlies these exceptions to the general rule of judicial indifference to the fairness of settlements?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d316f0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is the usual practice of judicial indifference defensible? Should judges be required to scrutinize all settlements for fairness? Before answering, imagine yourself as judge. Suppose a very common case—a rear-end vehicle collision in which plaintiff alleges soft-tissue injuries. Such injuries are common, but also commonly feigned. Defendant, represented by an insurer, has denied liability but has offered a small settlement. You, the judge, are asked to approve or reject the settlement. How would you reach a decision? What information would you want to have? Would your concern be substantive (is the settlement fair?) or procedural (did both parties know the material facts?)? Would the cost of gathering and presenting this information eliminate two of the chief advantages of settlement—speed and efficiency—and place additional burdens on the courts?</p></li>

For example, federal legislation regulates settlements releasing Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) claims: Offers must be clearly written; they must remain in effect for stated periods of time; the employer must advise employees to consult a lawyer; and they must give settling employees at least a week to revoke a signed settlement agreement. 29 U.S.C. §626(f). In Oubre v. Entergy Operations, Inc., 522 U.S. 422 (1998), the Court held that an employee who had released ADEA claims without these procedures could, without tendering back the money paid for a settlement, bring suit under the Act.</p></li>

As you will see in Chapter 11, under modern doctrines of former adjudication, a claim adjudicated on the merits is interpreted to bar all related claims, whether or not they were stated in the complaint. Such a mode of dismissal also means that if the plaintiff files a second lawsuit, the defendant can invoke not just the contract of settlement but the doctrines of former adjudication to have the suit dismissed. Rule 41(a) voluntary dismissals are treated as dismissals without prejudice “[u]nless the notice or stipulation states otherwise.” Accordingly, a savvy defense attorney will ensure that a notice of voluntary dismissal asks the court to dismiss the case “with prejudice.”</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0d33e11-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The usual answer is that the party seeking to enforce the settlement must sue for breach of contract, the contract in question being the settlement agreement. That suit must take its place at the back of the line of pending litigation: It gets no special attention by virtue of being a suit to enforce a settlement. Indeed, in federal court it may suffer a disadvantage. Jane Smart’s original suit, for employment discrimination, could invoke federal question jurisdiction. But the suit to enforce the settlement contract does not arise under federal law, so the employee can invoke federal jurisdiction only if there is diversity between her and her employer and the amount in controversy is satisfied—probably not the case if only a continuation of medical benefits are at stake. See Langley v. Jackson State University, 14 F.3d 1070 (5th Cir. 1994) (no federal jurisdiction to enforce settlement of federal civil rights claims).</p></li>

Suppose the obligation to pay medical benefits had been embodied in a judgment—usually called a “consent decree,” decree because it is a court order; consent because it embodies the parties’ consented-to settlement—in those circumstances either party can invoke the court’s jurisdiction to enforce its own judgments. The order of dismissal can also include a provision whereby the court “retains jurisdiction” over disputes concerning the terms of the settlement agreement.</p></li>

The captain of the vessel was shown to be drunk in his cabin during the critical time when course should have been changed through the tricky channel; worse, there was evidence suggesting that the defendant knew of the captain’s alcoholism but continued to employ him.

<p id="c0d3652c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Settlement negotiations sometimes fail. Broadly speaking, one can trace the failure of negotiations to two causes: divergent estimates of the case’s value and bad communication. In <i>Smart v. GrowCo</i>, perhaps either Smart or her lawyer misjudges the likely reaction of a jury to her story and therefore rejects GrowCo’s offer. Or GrowCo’s general counsel makes no offer, perhaps because he is determined to show the board of directors that he is a strong executive, or to accede to the demands of Senior Scientist who threatens otherwise to quit. Alternatively, the parties may have similar guesses about the outcome of litigation but may not be communicating clearly, perhaps because the parties or their lawyers have taken a dislike to one another. Any of these circumstances can lead to the collapse of negotiations.</p>
<p id="c0d3652d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometimes, however, negotiations that would otherwise fail can succeed if the parties have help. Help comes in several forms, depending on the nature of the problem and the source of help. If the problem is communication, someone who can facilitate those communications may be able to help. Generically, such facilitators are called mediators. What does a mediator do? One vision of “mediation” is as assisted negotiation, an aid in overcoming barriers to agreement.</p>
<p id="c0d3652e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another way to describe a mediator’s role is to frame it entirely in terms of process: The mediator seeks to engage the parties in a structured set of discussions leading to agreement. Because the goal is an agreement of the parties, the mediator <span title="541" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-541">p. 541</span>does not rule on the rights and wrongs of the dispute or tell the parties what to do. The mediator’s limited role is a function of the fact that she has no coercive power: The mediator succeeds only if the parties agree. A mediator typically talks with the parties (sometimes together, sometimes individually, sometimes both), to ferret out areas of agreement and possible starting points for negotiation, to discover the respective parties’ goals, and to suggest ways to accommodate these goals. The success of mediation depends partly on the level of trust the mediator is able to establish and partly on the distance separating the parties’ goals.</p>
<p id="c0d3652f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In recent decades, a cadre of professional mediators—many with legal training—has emerged, who offer their services to parties for a fee. Courts and legislatures have shown significant interest in the power of mediation to achieve settlements, and in some cases have established what sounds like a contradiction: mandatory mediation. Some states require cases to be submitted to mediation before they will set a trial date. In federal law the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998, 28 U.S.C. §§651 et seq., requires each federal district court to “authorize[],. . . . devise, and implement its own alternative dispute resolution program.” 28 U.S.C. §651(b). The statute’s goal becomes clear from a section instructing district courts to adopt a local rule that “require[s] litigants in all civil cases to consider the use of an alternative dispute resolution process at an appropriate state in the litigation” and to “provide litigants in all civil cases with at least one alternative dispute resolution proces. . . . ” The statute goes on to require training of “neutrals” to help the parties come to agreement.</p>
<p id="c0d36530-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Family law—divorce, support, and custody disputes—has been a frequent target for these efforts. In one view, the popularity of mediation in this context reflects the fact that some family conflicts by their nature are ideal for mediation; in another view, it is said to reflect the low importance attached to these cases by some judges and lawyers. Bear in mind, too, that some efforts described as mediation would be more accurately described as settlements arrived at under heavy pressure, in which the mediator threatens to report to the judge that one or another party is behaving unreasonably (sometimes called “muscle mediation,” and which is prohibited by some court rules and statutes).</p>

Such mediation is sometimes called “positional” and treats settlement as a pie to be divided, in which anything gained by one party is lost by the other. Such mediators can be useful if the parties have engaged in significant bluffing, failing to disclose their true settlement positions.</p></li>

This approach is sometimes called “interest-based” mediation. Suppose, for example, the mediator learns from Jane Smart that she is primarily interested in coming away from this dispute with a clean reference that will enable her to find another job and the dignity of not having been fired for cause. GrowCo, on the other hand, wants to be able to recruit future plant botanists and to continue to attract the interest of investors. Can you think of settlement agreements that would achieve both goals?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0d38c48-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the course of mediation a party or lawyer makes a statement of fact.

<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0d38c4a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One might take the view that they never should—that judges should be adjudicators, and should leave any settlement to the parties or to figures like court-appointed mediators.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d38c4b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whatever the merits of such a view, current procedural law does not support it. Two bodies of law allow a judge to actively manage litigation, personally and through delegates. Rule 16(a)(5) establishes “facilitating settlement” as one of the goals of pretrial conferences. Rule 16(c) contains a shopping list of management techniques ranging from establishing time limits to encouraging settlement. The Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998, 28 U.S.C. §§651 et seq., requires federal judicial districts to offer the parties, even after they have filed a suit, alternatives to litigation, such as mediation or nonbinding arbitration (described below).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d38c4c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act references “early neutral evaluation” as one possible approach. 28 U.S.C. §651(a). Early neutral evaluation embodies a simple idea: Parties tend to have excessively optimistic evaluations of their cases; presenting one’s case briefly to a neutral party who assesses its strengths and weaknesses will lead to a more realistic negotiating position. Such evaluators are typically volunteer lawyers or magistrate judges not otherwise involved in the case. By listening to the parties’ presentations, they offer each a reality check, enabling each party to see its own case’s weaknesses and its adversary’s strengths. Notice that with neutral evaluation we are moving away from the world of mediation and toward a sneak preview of litigation.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d38c4d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another variation is the “summary jury trial” as a settlement device. Summary jury trials are not real trials at all. Instead, lawyers present their cases to a mock “jury” in very abbreviated form (usually narrating what the evidence will show rather than calling actual witnesses). The “jury” is <span title="543" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-543">p. 543</span>charged, deliberates, and returns its verdict, which, however, is not binding. Instead, the verdict serves as a reality check: The plaintiff who thought his case was worth $250,000 discovers the “jury” was willing to award only $50,000; the defendant who thought she would win a defense verdict finds herself stung by significant damages. The hope underlying all these processes is that actually “losing” a low-cost version of the case (or winning less than was hoped for) may cause the parties to settle.</p></li>

<p id="c0d38c50-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants and plaintiffs sometimes share the goal that any settlement be confidential. Consider again our hypothetical case, <i>Smart v. GrowCo</i>. Suppose that Smart files her unlawful discharge action, and GrowCo counterclaims for an injunction forbidding Smart from disclosing any trade secrets. As in many such cases, discovery yields information that makes both sides unhappy. Depositions suggest that Senior Scientist has exhibited behavior toward a number of women that may look quite bad to a jury and that might make it hard to recruit future plant geneticists. Depositions and documents also suggest that Smart, in addition to great talent and skill in plant genetics, has unorthodox work habits and a very free hand with expense accounts that may not endear her to future employers. In addition, there is the matter of the disputed patents and trade secrets. In such a case, both parties might desire some measure of confidentiality concerning both the information unearthed during discovery and the ultimate resolution of the case.</p>
<p id="c0d38c51-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most commonly, confidentiality agreements seek to bar specific information or documents from public exposure. Can the parties do this—and with what limits?</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0d3b364-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider how a confidentiality agreement might add value to the settlement.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0d3b365-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A confidentiality agreement could certainly add value for Jane Smart. Smart would probably like not to publicize the fact that she sued her former employer, for fear that it would cause some prospective employer not to hire her. Although the fact that she filed a suit will always be a matter of public record, a confidentiality agreement can prevent GrowCo from revealing it. Absent such a revelation, only a diligent employer who searched court records would learn about the suit. Return of the documents and records might also prevent others from learning the facts revealed by discovery—such as Smart’s unorthodox work habits and expense account use. Discovery requests and responses and depositions are not filed with the court unless included as part of a motion. See Rule 5(d)(1). Therefore, a persistent and diligent employer who searches court records could only learn such facts if they were included in a motion filed with the court.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d3b366-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="544" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-544">p. 544</span>A confidentiality agreement would also add value for GrowCo. The company would be concerned about maintaining confidentiality of any non-patented trade secrets (patents themselves are public records but there are often related unpatented processes). GrowCo would also want to prevent others from learning about certain facts revealed by discovery, such as the sexist behavior of Senior Scientist. Finally, GrowCo wants to discourage other terminated employees from filing suit, and therefore has an interest in maintaining confidential the amount of money it paid to settle Smart’s claims.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d3b367-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice, however, that on these facts, protecting Smart’s and GrowCo’s interests may impose burdens on others. Suppose there is a group of scientists working for GrowCo who have been subjected to similar behavior by Senior Scientist. They have not brought suit in part because they suspect that no one will believe them. If they knew that Smart had successfully asserted such a claim, they might be emboldened to assert similar claims. How should the law deal with such “collateral damage” from confidential settlements?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0d3b368-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At a technical level, how might a settlement agreement be drafted to maintain confidentiality?

He gives it to you for review, asking whether it will fulfill the clients’ expectations:</p>

Both parties agree to return all originals and copies of all documents and data, obtained from Jane Smart or GrowCo, directly or indirectly, at any time, by either party, or any agent, attorney, representative, or anyone else acting or purporting to act on his or her behalf. Insofar as they apply to Jane Smart, the obligations of this Paragraph 7 are cumulative to other existing obligations that Smart has as a result of her employment with GrowCo.</p>

Each disclosure by Parties or their attorneys or by any recipient of information from Plaintiff or their attorneys concerning this Settlement other than a disclosure expressly permitted by subparagraph 8.1 shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement. For each such breach of the confidentiality provision set forth in subparagraph 8.1, the Party who breaches such confidentiality provision shall be solely liable to the other Party for Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) in liquidated damages. Parties, and each of them, agree that said sum represents a reasonable estimate of the actual damages which would be suffered by [Party’s Name] as a result of a violation of subparagraph 8.1 and that this sum is not punitive in any way. In the event a Party is required to file suit or otherwise seek judicial enforcement of its rights under this paragraph 8, the Party who breaches such confidentiality provision shall be solely liable for attorneys’ fees and costs incurred as a result thereof.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0d3b36e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The agreement imposes two different obligations on the parties: to return all documents exchanged during the course of litigation, and to not disclose the terms of the settlement or confidentiality agreement.

How would one enforce such an agreement were there not a liquidated damages clause? One would have to show not only breach of the agreement but also prove damages, and damages may be difficult to establish for the disclosure of confidential information. (Note, though, that under contract law an unreasonable estimate of liquidated damages may void the whole clause.)</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0d3da80-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As matters now stand, such contractual confidentiality agreements are generally enforceable, but what exactly do they protect against? At a minimum, they would prohibit the plaintiff from holding a news conference to announce the terms of the settlement. What could defendant do if, after entering into such a settlement, plaintiff took such an action?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d3da81-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why did the lawyer who drafted the agreement quoted above create an exception for disclosures “as required by judicial process, or as otherwise required by law"? Suppose that one of GrowCo’s competitors sues it for abusive deployment of one of its patents—behavior thought by some to violate the antitrust laws. In the course of that lawsuit, the competitor seeks to depose Jane Smart about her lawsuit and the patent dispute she had with GrowCo. Assume that a court rules that GrowCo’s treatment of Smart’s patent claims is relevant to show a pattern of abusive use of patents. Can Smart refuse to answer on grounds of her confidentiality agreement? Can GrowCo get a court order to prevent Competitor from taking Smart’s deposition? Respond after reading the next case, which exemplifies the courts’ approach to such agreements when the underlying facts become relevant in a subsequent case.<span title="546" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-546">p. 546</span></p></li>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0d3da8a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">Discussion</p></div>
<p id="c0d3da8b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In general, the scope of discovery is very broad. “Parties may obtain discovery regarding <i>any</i> [<i>unprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense</i>”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1046D_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1046D_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">3</a></span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) (emphasis added). The primary goal of the court and discovery is “to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.</p>
<p id="c0d4019d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The public interest favors judicial policies which promote the completion of litigation. Public interest also seeks to protect the finality of prior suits and the secrecy of settlements when desired by the settling parties. However, the courts also serve society by providing a public forum for issues of general concern. The case at bar presents a direct conflict between these crucial public and private interests.</p>
<p id="c0d4019e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To allow full discovery into all aspects of Ms. Thomas’s case could discourage similar settlements. Confidential settlements benefit society and the parties involved by resolving disputes relatively quickly, with slight judicial intervention, and presumably result in greater satisfaction to the parties. Sound judicial policy fosters and protects this form of alternative dispute resolution. See, e.g., Fed. R. Evid. 408 which protects compromises and offers to compromise by rendering them inadmissible to prove liability. The secrecy of a settlement agreement and the contractual rights of the parties thereunder deserve court protection.</p>
<p id="c0d4019f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="547" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-547">p. 547</span>On the other hand, to prevent any discovery into Ms. Thomas’s case based upon the settlement agreement results in disturbing consequences. First, as pointed out by Kalinauskas, preventing the deposition of Ms. Thomas would condone the practice of “buy[ing] the silence of a witness with a settlement agreement.” This court harbors little doubt that preventing the dissemination of the underlying facts which prompted Ms. Thomas to file suit is in Caesars’s interest, and formed an important part of the agreement to Caesars. Caesars avers that without the confidentiality order the <i>Thomas</i> case would not have settled. Yet despite this freedom to contract, the courts must carefully police the circumstances under which litigants seek to protect their interests while concealing legitimate areas of public concern. This concern grows more pressing as additional individuals are harmed by identical or similar action.</p>
<p id="c0d401a0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the deposition of Ms. Thomas is likely to lead to relevant evidence. Preventing the deposition of Ms. Thomas or the discovery of documents created in her case could lead to wasteful efforts to generate discovery already in existence. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d401a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Caesars[’s] motion for a protective order preventing the deposition of Ms. Thomas rests entirely upon the confidential settlement agreement. Caesars. . . . maintains that it should be able to rely upon the confidentiality order to protect against [disclosure to] third parties, unless extraordinary circumstances or compelling need justifies some breach of secrecy. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d401a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Caesars’s] argument that Kalinauskas must show a compelling need to obtain discovery applies to discovery of the specific terms of the settlement agreement (i.e., the amount and conditions of the agreement), not [to] factual information surrounding Thomas’s case. Caesars should not be able to conceal basic facts of concern to Kalinauskas in her case, and of legitimate public concern, regarding employment at its place of business.</p>
<p id="c0d401a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, keeping in mind the liberal nature of discovery, this court will allow the deposition of Ms. Thomas. . . . The deposition of Ms. Thomas and any further discovery into the Thomas case must not, however, disclose any substantive terms of the Caesars-Thomas settlement agreement. Naturally, Ms. Thomas may answer questions regarding her employment at Caesars and any knowledge of sexual harassment.</p>
<p id="c0d401a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the terms of the confidential settlement agreement impose penalties upon Ms. Thomas for discussing her past employment at Caesars, those penalties shall not apply to the disclosure of information for discovery purposes in furtherance of Kalinauskas’s case. Indeed, the settlement agreement itself makes exception for court ordered release of information.</p>
<p id="c0d401a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While settlement is an important objective, an overzealous quest for alternative dispute resolution can distort the proper role of the court.

Why do defendants want them? What do they hope to get from them? And are they good or bad as a matter of public policy?</p>
<p id="c0d44fdb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now know from <i>Kalinauskas</i> and cases like it that a confidentiality agreement or a sealed record cannot “buy silence”: Witnesses with relevant information about the underlying facts of a case can testify about those facts regardless of confidentiality agreements. An agreement that tried to forbid such testimony would almost certainly be struck down as a violation of public policy.</p>
<p id="c0d44fdc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Caesars might still stand to gain a great deal through a confidentiality agreement, though. Suppose there are several prospective plaintiffs allegedly harmed by the same actions of defendant—for example, if the same supervisor at Caesars Palace had harassed several other employees. By barring Ms. Thomas from talking about her settlement, Caesars might hope that the settlement might not encourage similarly situated employees to sue. But ordinary workplace gossip occurring well before the confidentiality agreement would likely alert others that Ms. Thomas had sued—indeed her lawyer might well ask her to spread the word in order to elicit others’ stories of harassment.</p>
<p id="c0d44fdd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Caesars might also believe that the confidentiality agreement would make it more difficult for other plaintiffs to benefit from the <i>Thomas</i> litigation. Suppose there was no confidentiality agreement or sealed record in <i>Thomas</i>. A new plaintiff with a similar claim might simply call Ms. Thomas’s lawyer and request the discovery exchanged in her case to save the cost and trouble of doing her own investigation and discovery. The confidentiality agreement requires future plaintiffs to absorb the full costs of investigation and discovery.</p>
<p id="c0d44fde-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs’ lawyers are of two minds about confidentiality agreements. In any given case, accepting a confidentiality agreement may be the key to settlement, or may result in the client getting more money, sometimes referred to as a “confidentiality premium.” On the other hand, confidentiality agreements and sealed discovery may delay public knowledge of dangerous or unlawful situations, or repeated bad behavior by the same defendant. Suppose a defendant repeatedly dumps toxic chemicals into a residential area, or engages in serial harassment. Even if some plaintiffs come forward, settlements requiring confidentiality and sealed discovery prevent the knowledge about these harms from spreading quickly. Arguably, courts should not be in the business of abetting such concealment. Moreover, if discovery in prior cases is available, it will reduce the expense of subsequent, similar lawsuits—a desirable outcome if such suits will force a defendant to change unlawful practices. Some states have captured this idea in legislation; in Washington, a <span title="550" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-550">p. 550</span>statute declares that the public has a right to information from products liability or hazardous substance cases “necessary for a lay member of the public to understand the nature, source, and extent of the risk from alleged hazards” and requires a court considering a protective order to weigh that public interest. Wash. Rev. Code Ann. §4.24.611(1)(c)(2). Should a statute similarly mandate transparency in sexual harassment cases?</p>

<p id="c0d476f3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Parties can enter into contracts to settle lawsuits, and they can employ mediators to help them reach such settlements. But what if the parties cannot agree, even with the help of a mediator, or can agree only that they want to have their disputes decided by a third party. Is their only choice to resort to the courts? No. Arbitration is one of the oldest and best-established alternatives to litigating in court. Unlike a mediator, an arbitrator decides a dispute after having heard from both sides. Arbitration, in other words, closely resembles adjudication—private, nonjudicial adjudication, but still adjudication.</p>
<p id="c0d476f4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why, if it is so much like adjudication, do the parties not simply proceed through the court system? Sometimes the reasons are purely practical; for example, the parties may be able to arrange hearing dates and locations that are more convenient for counsel and witnesses. But arbitration can have more fundamental differences—differences that, depending on the case, may advantage one party and disadvantage the other:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="c0d476f5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike court adjudication, binding arbitration results in an award that is essentially final and not subject to further challenge, with very limited exceptions, such as proof that the arbitrator was corrupt or the agreement to arbitrate was unconscionable. The absence of appeal prevents the case from dragging on, but may also protect from reversal an arbitrary, unfair result.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0d476f6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Parties can choose the arbitrator. The choice may simply be someone who has a reputation for being fair and reasonable. Or, the parties may arrange that the arbitrator will be someone who is experienced in the subject matter of the dispute (be it medical malpractice, engineering, or securities) in the expectation that this will produce a fairer result than could be obtained before even a highly qualified, but generalist, judge or a lay jury. Again, this might be viewed as a disadvantage to a party whose case contravenes conventional wisdom in that subject area, or a party whose case is long on emotion but short on the facts and the law.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0d476f7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arbitration permits the parties to determine what substantive rules apply—they can insist, for example, that the arbitrator will not refer to the ordinary rules of contract but instead will adhere to the traditions that have developed <span title="551" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-551">p. 551</span>around this particular commercial relationship. As a result, the arbitrator, though deciding the dispute, may decide it more “softly” than a court:</p>

<p id="c0d476f8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is said of the American commercial arbitrator that he may “do justice as he sees it, applying his own sense of the law and equity to the facts as he finds them to be and making an award reflecting the spirit rather than the letter of the agreement.” Many awards resulting from such proceedings might also be described as Solomonic, halving the objects in dispute.</p>

</li>

<li><p id="c0d476fa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Parties can also dictate which procedural rules apply in the arbitration. Sometimes that results in processes that are scarcely distinguishable from judicial adjudication—full discovery followed by a hearing that looks very much like a trial. In other cases, the parties may agree to depart dramatically from legal process (<i>Ferguson v. Writer’s Guild of America, West</i>, infra page 567, is an example). As you will see in <i>Epic Systems</i>, infra page 559, a current issue in arbitration agreements is the extent to which the parties may contract out of class actions and class arbitrations.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0d476fb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arbitration <i>can</i> be less expensive than adjudication. The parties can take several steps that may make the process cheaper: dispensing with, or substantially curtailing, the rules of discovery; agreeing that most (or all) witnesses can testify by affidavit rather than in person; truncating the hearing through agreed-upon time limits. The one service that is usually more expensive in arbitration is the time of the arbitrator. Taxpayers pay the salaries of judges; the construction and upkeep of the courthouse are also expenses largely borne by taxpayers. Arbitrators, in contrast, charge by the hour—often at rates in excess of those charged by attorneys. And one common form of arbitration uses three arbitrators (one chosen by each party, with the third chosen by the first two); in such a case each day of arbitration can cost $10,000—just for the arbitrators.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0d476fc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arbitration is more confidential than ordinary adjudication. The public, including the press, normally have the right to attend judicial proceedings. Unless protected by judicial order, documents filed in court and transcripts of judicial proceedings are normally public records. In contrast, arbitration hearings are normally not open to the public, and the parties can even agree that the outcome of the arbitration be kept private.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0d476fd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arbitration may avoid the vagaries in outcome that a jury may introduce, although one has to be careful here: If a jury acts in a lawless way, its verdict is subject to reversal, while arbitration “awards” are not subject to judicial review except for the most extreme reasons.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="c0d49e0e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Agreements to arbitrate can occur at several points in a dispute. Sometimes they come after the parties have already begun litigation. A post-dispute agreement to arbitrate is uncontroversially enforceable—a party cannot commence arbitration and then back out.</p>
<p id="c0d49e0f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="552" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-552">p. 552</span>But arbitration agreements often come long before any dispute, much less a lawsuit, has arisen. In recent years, an increasing number of organizations have included arbitration provisions in their contracts for a wide range of products and services: employment, credit cards, cell phones, medical care, financial services, and software—to name just a few. Judicial attitudes toward enforcement of pre-dispute arbitration agreements have undergone a swing historically, and the pendulum appears still to be moving. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, some courts refused to enforce pre-dispute arbitration agreements under any circumstances. By case law and statute, however, the rule has generally been changed in favor of their enforcement. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court, which once viewed with suspicion the arbitration of claims arising under federal statutes, has enforced agreements to arbitrate many kinds of statutory claims—for example, antitrust claims, securities law claims and, most recently, employment discrimination claims—so long as the arbitration procedure does not effectively prevent the claimant from vindicating her statutory rights.</p>
<p id="c0d49e10-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some of these arbitration agreements arise in situations where one party essentially dictates the terms of the contract (including the terms of the arbitration agreement) to the other party on a “take-it-or-leave-it” basis. The employer, for example, makes acceptance of an employer-drafted arbitration agreement a condition of employment. In recent years, courts have looked more closely at the fairness of the arbitration process before enforcing an arbitration agreement in such contexts.</p>

<p id="c0d49e13-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To understand the framework for courts’ scrutiny of arbitration agreements, one has to understand the relation of state and federal law in this area: Very roughly speaking, federal law declares the general enforceability of agreements to arbitrate, but allows state law to set some limits on those agreements. Inside those boundaries, states are allowed to regulate arbitration, but if they step over those boundaries, federal law displaces (“preempts” in lawyer-talk) that of the states.</p>
<p id="c0d49e14-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. §§2 et seq., enacted in 1925 to counter judicial hostility to pre-dispute arbitration agreements, has three basic sections.</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="c0d49e15-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 2 consists of substantive law, broadly declaring agreements to arbitrate valid as a matter of federal law: “A written provision in any. . . . contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction. . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” This section has been held to be binding on both federal and state courts, so that a state legislature or court may not, for example, declare that arbitration clauses in employment contracts are unenforceable under any circumstances. And the “involving commerce” provision has been given an expansive definition.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0d49e16-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="553" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-553">p. 553</span>Section 3 tells the courts what to do if a party, in spite of an arbitration agreement, instead files a lawsuit: “If any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the United States upon any issue referable to arbitration. . . . , the court in which such suit is pending. . . . shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration [occurs], providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.”</p></li>
<li><p id="c0d49e17-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 4 tells the federal courts what to do if a party neither invokes arbitration nor files suit: “A party aggrieved by the alleged failure, neglect, or refusal of another to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration may petition any United States district court which, save for such agreement, would have jurisdiction under Title 28. . . . , for an order directing that such arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="c0d49e18-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That structure provides a roadmap for a party seeking an order to enforce an arbitration agreement, but it leaves out one ingredient that will doubtless have occurred to the civil procedure student—the ordering court’s jurisdiction.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0d49e19-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Arbitration Act is something of an anomaly in the field of federal-court jurisdiction. It creates a body of federal substantive law establishing and regulating the duty to honor an agreement to arbitrate, yet it does not create any independent federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §1331 or otherwise. Section 4 provides for an order compelling arbitration only when the federal district court would have jurisdiction over a suit on the underlying dispute; hence, there must be diversity of citizenship or some other independent basis for federal jurisdiction before the order can issue. Section 3 likewise limits the federal courts to the extent that a federal court cannot stay a suit pending before it unless there is such a suit in existence. Nevertheless, although enforcement of the Act is left in large part to the state courts, it nevertheless represents federal policy to be vindicated by the federal courts where otherwise appropriate.</p>

<p id="c0d4c52b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has also made clear that state courts are bound to enforce this national policy in favor of enforcement of arbitration agreements. Demonstrating that it meant what it said, the Court has required state courts to enforce arbitration agreements even when they contravene state law if the underlying transaction involves commerce. In such situations the Court has said that the Arbitration Act, not state law, controls and that the states are bound to enforce the Act and permit arbitration to proceed.</p>
<p id="c0d4c52c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the near-century since the passage of the Federal Arbitration Act, the Supreme Court has interpreted it to apply to a widening range of cases—not just business-to-business contract disputes that were likely at the front of Congress’s mind when the Act was adopted, but to a variety of other claims, including those arising under federal securities laws, antitrust laws, employment discrimination claims, and more. As a result, some claims that once would have been triable to a jury and subject to appellate review have become subject to arbitration.</p>
<p id="c0d4c52d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="554" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-554">p. 554</span>In many of these types of cases, agreements to arbitrate were not negotiated by both parties to the agreement—instead, they were provisions in standard consumer and employment contracts that were drafted by companies with limited or no opportunity for negotiation by the consumer or employee. Consumers and employees subject to these arbitration agreements have repeatedly challenged them as unenforceable; in recent years federal courts have often rejected those challenges.</p>
<p id="c0d4c52e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When, under §2 of the Arbitration Act, could an agreement to arbitrate be unenforceable? Only, says the Act, on a ground that would apply to all contracts, not just contracts to arbitrate. Thus if I sign an agreement to arbitrate only because of a threat of violence, it—like all contracts entered under duress—is unenforceable. The portion of general contracts doctrine most frequently deployed to challenge arbitration clauses is unconscionability. Indeed, some claim that recent unconscionability decisions around the country arise almost entirely from arbitration contexts. Consider just one example, where a federal court applied a state’s law of unconscionability to strike down an arbitration agreement.</p>

Casarotto, 517 U.S. 681, 687 (1996). California courts may invalidate an arbitration clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0d4ec4a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made, the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0d4ec4b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This statute, however, does not define unconscionability. Instead, we look to the California Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Armendariz</i>, which provides the definitive pronouncement of California law on unconscionability to be applied to mandatory arbitration agreements, such as the one at issue in this case. In order to render a contract unenforceable under the doctrine of unconscionability, there must be both a procedural and substantive element of unconscionability. These two elements, however, need not both be present in the same degree. Thus, for example, the more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable.</p>

A determination of whether a contract is procedurally unconscionable focuses on two factors: oppression and surprise. Oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice. Surprise involves the extent to which the supposedly agreed-upon terms of the bargain are hidden in the prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms.</p>

We found the agreement to be procedurally unconscionable because Circuit City, which possesses considerably more bargaining power than nearly all of its employees or applicants, drafted the contract and uses it as its standard arbitration agreement for all of its new employees. The agreement is a prerequisite to employment, and job applicants are not permitted to modify the agreement’s terms—they must take the contract or leave it.</p>

</div>
<p id="c0d51267-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Countrywide’s arbitration agreement has a provision that requires the employee to “pay to NAF [National Arbitration Forum] its filing fee up to a maximum of $125.00 when the Claim is filed. The Company shall pay for the first hearing day. All other arbitration costs shall be shared equally by the Company and the Employee.” Countrywide argues that this provision is not so one-sided as to “shock the conscience” and, therefore, is enforceable.</p>

<p id="c0d5126c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ferguson also argues that the discovery provision in the arbitration agreement is one-sided and, therefore, unconscionable. The discovery provision states that “a deposition of a corporate representative shall be limited to no more than four designated subjects,” but does not impose a similar limitation on depositions of employees. Ferguson also notes that the arbitration agreement sets mutual limitations (e.g., no more than three depositions) and mutual advantages (e.g., unlimited expert witnesses) which favor Countrywide because it is in a superior position to gather information regarding its business practices and employees’ conduct, and has greater access to funds to pay for expensive expert witnesses.</p>
<p id="c0d5126d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ferguson urges this court to affirm the district court’s ruling that the discovery provision is unconscionable on the ground that the limitations and mutual advantages on discovery are unfairly one-sided and have no commercial justification other than “maximizing employer advantage,” which is an improper basis for such differences under <i>Armendariz</i>. Countrywide argues to the contrary that the arbitration agreement provides for ample discovery by employees.</p>
<p id="c0d5126e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Armendariz</i>, the California Supreme Court held that employees are “at least entitled to discovery sufficient to adequately arbitrate their statutory claims, including access to essential documents and witnesses.” Adequate discovery, however, does not mean unfettered discovery. As <i>Armendariz</i> recognized, an arbitration agreement might specify “something less than the full panoply of discovery provided in the California Code of Civil Procedure.”</p>
<p id="c0d5126f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Mercuro</i>, the California Court of Appeals applied the parameters set forth in <i>Armendariz</i> to Countrywide’s discovery provisions. It concluded that “without evidence showing how these discovery provisions are applied in practice, we are not prepared to say they would not necessarily prevent Mercuro from vindicating his statutory rights.” <i>Mercuro</i> relied heavily on the ability of the arbitrator to extend the discovery <span title="558" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-558">p. 558</span>limits for “good cause.” In fact, <i>Mercuro</i> ultimately left it up to the arbitrator to balance the need for simplicity in arbitration with the discovery necessary for a party to vindicate her claims. Following the Court in <i>Mercuro</i>, we too find that Countrywide’s discovery provisions may afford Ferguson adequate discovery to vindicate her claims.</p>
<p id="c0d51270-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, we recognize an insidious pattern in Countrywide’s arbitration agreement. Not only do these discovery provisions appear to favor Countrywide at the expense of its employees, but the entire agreement seems drawn to provide Countrywide with undue advantages should an employment-related dispute arise. Aside from merely availing itself of the cost-saving benefits of arbitration, Countrywide has sought to advantage itself substantively by tilting the playing field.</p>
<p id="c0d51271-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While many of its arbitration provisions appear equally applicable to both parties, these provisions may work to curtail the employee’s ability to substantiate any claim against the employer. We follow <i>Mercuro</i> in holding that the discovery provisions alone are not unconscionable, but in the context of an arbitration agreement which unduly favors Countrywide at every turn, we find that their inclusion reaffirms our belief that the arbitration agreement as a whole is substantively unconscionable.</p>

For an almost contemporaneous case upholding the same clause in the same employment contract—applying the Texas rather than the California unconscionability precedents—see Carter v. Countrywide Credit Industries, Inc., 362 F.3d 294 (5th Cir. 2004).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d53987-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is typical about <i>Ferguson</i> is the framework it deploys.

<li class=""><p id="c0d53988-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What procedure did the defendants then use to attempt to force the claims into arbitration?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0d5398a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Next consider the analytic framework, of “procedural” and “substantive” unconscionability. What do these terms mean as they are revealed in <i>Ferguson</i>?</p></li>

<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0d5398c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Smart brings a state court lawsuit alleging unlawful discharge. If GrowCo wants to arbitrate rather than litigate the suit, it would file a motion in the state court to stay the action pending arbitration. By filing for a stay rather than for a dismissal, the stayed action can become the vehicle for enforcing the arbitrator’s award. Seeking a stay rather than a dismissal also takes care of the situation in which there are issues not resolved by the arbitration award.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d5398d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If Smart has moved away from GrowCo’s home state, can GrowCo ask a federal court to enforce the arbitration clause? If Smart is still in GrowCo’s state, can it do so? The answer depends on whether there is subject matter jurisdiction in federal court. As noted above, the FAA does not, on its own, grant any party federal court jurisdiction to enforce arbitration agreements. Even if GrowCo cannot invoke federal jurisdiction, however, it can still enforce the FAA in state courts, which are substantively bound by the provisions of the FAA.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d5398e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose Smart wants to challenge the arbitration clause as unconscionable. What additional factual details—about the clause and the context in which it was agreed to—would you want to know?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0d5609f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Ferguson v. Countrywide</i>, the court found that the California law of unconscionability squeezed inside the exceptions clause of the Arbitration Act because it was based on “such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” In 2011, the Supreme Court reached the opposite conclusion in <i>AT&amp;T v. Concepcion</i>, a 5-4 decision involving a cell phone contract, finding that California law’s interpretation of unconscionability was preempted by the FAA. In the next case, the U.S. Supreme Court again came to a similar conclusion in a closely divided case (upholding the arbitration clause against challenge)—this time considering a federal statute rather than state law as a possible escape from arbitration. The majority and dissenting opinions offer good summaries of competing histories of the FAA.</p></li>

<p id="c0d560a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should employees and employers be allowed to agree that any disputes between them will be resolved through one-on-one arbitration?

<p id="c0d560a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a matter of policy these questions are surely debatable. But as a matter of law the answer is clear. In the Federal Arbitration Act, Congress has instructed federal courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms—including terms <span title="560" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-560">p. 560</span>providing for individualized proceedings. Nor can we agree with the employees’ suggestion that the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) offers a conflicting command. It is this Court’s duty to interpret Congress’s statutes as a harmonious whole rather than at war with one another. And abiding that duty here leads to an unmistakable conclusion. The NLRA secures to employees rights to organize unions and bargain collectively, but it says nothing about how judges and arbitrators must try legal disputes that leave the workplace and enter the courtroom or arbitral forum. This Court has never read a right to class actions into the NLRA—and for three quarters of a century neither did the National Labor Relations Board. Far from conflicting, the Arbitration Act and the NLRA have long enjoyed separate spheres of influence and neither permits this Court to declare the parties’ agreements unlawful.</p>

<p id="c0d560a8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The three cases before us differ in detail but not in substance. Take <i>Ernst &amp; Young LLP v. Morris</i>. There Ernst &amp; Young and one of its junior accountants, Stephen Morris, entered into an agreement providing that they would arbitrate any disputes that might arise between them. The agreement stated that the employee could choose the arbitration provider and that the arbitrator could “grant any relief that could be granted by. . . . a court” in the relevant jurisdiction. The agreement also specified individualized arbitration, with claims “pertaining to different [e]mployees [to] be heard in separate proceedings.”</p>
<p id="c0d560a9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After his employment ended, and despite having agreed to arbitrate claims against the firm, Mr. Morris sued Ernst &amp; Young in federal court. He alleged that the firm had misclassified its junior accountants as professional employees and violated the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and California law by paying them salaries without overtime pay. Although the arbitration agreement provided for individualized proceedings, Mr. Morris sought to litigate the federal claim on behalf of a nationwide class under the FLSA’s collective action provision, 29 U.S.C. §216(b). He sought to pursue the state law claim as a class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.</p>
<p id="c0d560aa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ernst &amp; Young replied with a motion to compel arbitration. The district court granted the request, but the Ninth Circuit reversed this judgment. The Ninth Circuit recognized that the Arbitration Act generally requires courts to enforce arbitration agreements as written. But the court reasoned that the statute’s “saving clause,” see 9 U.S.C. §2, removes this obligation if an arbitration agreement violates some other federal law. And the court concluded that an agreement requiring individualized arbitration proceedings violates the NLRA by barring employees from engaging in the “concerted activit[y],” of pursuing claims as a class or collective action. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d560ab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the Arbitration Act and the NLRA have long coexisted—they date from 1925 and 1935, respectively—the suggestion they might conflict is something quite new. Until a couple of years ago, courts more or less agreed that arbitration agreements like those before us must be enforced according to their terms. . . . </p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0d587bc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">II</p></div>
<p id="c0d587bd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We begin with the Arbitration Act and the question of its saving clause.</p>
<p id="c0d587be-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress adopted the Arbitration Act in 1925 in response to a perception that courts were unduly hostile to arbitration. No doubt there was much to that perception. <span title="561" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-561">p. 561</span>Before 1925, English and American common law courts routinely refused to enforce agreements to arbitrate disputes. But in Congress’s judgment arbitration had more to offer than courts recognized—not least the promise of quicker, more informal, and often cheaper resolutions for everyone involved. So Congress directed courts to abandon their hostility and instead treat arbitration agreements as “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.” 9 U.S.C. §2. The Act, this Court has said, establishes “a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.”</p>
<p id="c0d587bf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not only did Congress require courts to respect and enforce agreements to arbitrate; it also specifically directed them to respect and enforce the parties’ chosen arbitration procedures.</p>
<p id="c0d587c0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On first blush, these emphatic directions would seem to resolve any argument under the Arbitration Act. The parties before us contracted for arbitration. They proceeded to specify the rules that would govern their arbitrations, indicating their intention to use individualized rather than class or collective action procedures. And this much the Arbitration Act seems to protect pretty absolutely. See AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333 (2011); <i>Italian Colors</i>, <i>supra</i>; DIRECTV, Inc. v. Imburgia, 577 U.S. ___ (2015). You might wonder if the balance Congress struck in 1925 between arbitration and litigation should be revisited in light of more contemporary developments. You might even ask if the Act was good policy when enacted. But all the same you might find it difficult to see how to avoid the statute’s application.</p>
<p id="c0d587c1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Still, the employees suggest the Arbitration Act’s saving clause creates an exception for cases like theirs. By its terms, the saving clause allows courts to refuse to enforce arbitration agreements “upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” §2. That provision applies here, the employees tell us, because the NLRA renders their particular class and collective action waivers illegal. In their view, illegality under the NLRA is a “ground” that “exists at law. . . . for the revocation” of their arbitration agreements, at least to the extent those agreements prohibit class or collective action proceedings.</p>
<p id="c0d587c2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The problem with this line of argument is fundamental. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d587c3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The clause] can’t [apply] because the saving clause recognizes only defenses that apply to “any” contract. In this way the clause establishes a sort of “equal-treatment” rule for arbitration contracts. The clause “permits agreements to arbitrate to be invalidated by ’generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability.’” <i>Concepcion</i>. At the same time, the clause offers no refuge for “defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.” Under our precedent, this means the saving clause does not save defenses that target arbitration either by name or by more subtle methods, such as by “interfer[ing] with fundamental attributes of arbitration.”</p>
<p id="c0d587c4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is where the employees’ argument stumbles. They don’t suggest that their arbitration agreements were extracted, say, by an act of fraud or duress or in some other unconscionable way that would render <i>any</i> contract unenforceable. Instead, they object to their agreements precisely because they require individualized arbitration proceedings instead of class or collective ones. And by attacking (only) the individualized nature of the arbitration proceedings, the employees’ argument seeks to interfere with one of arbitration’s fundamental attributes.</p>
<p id="c0d587c5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We know this much because of <i>Concepcion</i>. There this Court faced a state law defense that prohibited as unconscionable class action waivers in consumer contracts. <span title="562" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-562">p. 562</span>The Court readily acknowledged that the defense formally applied in both the litigation and the arbitration context. But, the Court held, the defense failed to qualify for protection under the saving clause because it interfered with a fundamental attribute of arbitration all the same. It did so by effectively permitting any party in arbitration to demand classwide proceedings despite the traditionally individualized and informal nature of arbitration. This “fundamental” change to the traditional arbitration process, the Court said, would “sacrific[e] the principal advantage of arbitration—its informality—and mak[e] the process slower, more costly, and more likely to generate procedural morass than final judgment.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0d587c6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, <i>Concepcion</i> has its limits. The Court recognized that parties remain free to alter arbitration procedures to suit their tastes, and in recent years some parties have sometimes chosen to arbitrate on a classwide basis. But <i>Concepcion</i>’s essential insight remains: courts may not allow a contract defense to reshape traditional individualized arbitration by mandating classwide arbitration procedures without the parties’ consent. Just as judicial antagonism toward arbitration before the Arbitration Act’s enactment “manifested itself in a great variety of devices and formulas declaring arbitration against public policy,” <i>Concepcion</i> teaches that we must be alert to new devices and formulas that would achieve much the same result today. And a rule seeking to declare individualized arbitration proceedings off limits is, the Court held, just such a device. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d587c7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Illegality [the term used by the NLRA statute], like unconscionability, may be a traditional, generally applicable contract defense in many cases, including arbitration cases. But an argument that a contract is unenforceable <i>just because it requires bilateral arbitration</i> is a different creature. A defense of that kind, <i>Concepcion</i> tells us, is one that impermissibly disfavors arbitration whether it sounds in illegality or unconscionability. The law of precedent teaches that like cases should generally be treated alike, and appropriate respect for that principle means the Arbitration Act’s saving clause can no more save the defense at issue in these cases than it did the defense at issue in <i>Concepcion</i>. At the end of our encounter with the Arbitration Act, then, it appears just as it did at the beginning: a congressional command requiring us to enforce, not override, the terms of the arbitration agreements before us.</p>

<p id="c0d5aedb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our decision does nothing to override Congress’s policy judgments. As the dissent recognizes, the legislative policy embodied in the NLRA is aimed at “safeguard[ing], first and foremost, workers’ rights to join unions and to engage in collective bargaining.” Those rights stand every bit as strong today as they did yesterday. And rather than revive “yellow dog” contracts against union organizing that the NLRA outlawed back in 1935, today’s decision merely declines to read into the NLRA a novel <span title="563" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-563">p. 563</span>right to class action procedures that the Board’s own general counsel disclaimed as recently as 2010. . . . </p>

While Congress is of course always free to amend this judgment, we see nothing suggesting it did so in the NLRA—much less that it manifested a clear intention to displace the Arbitration Act. Because we can easily read Congress’s statutes to work in harmony, that is where our duty lies. The judgments in <i>Epic</i> and <i>Ernst &amp; Young</i> are reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

But by joining together with others similarly circumstanced, employees can gain effective redress for wage underpayment commonly experienced. To block such concerted action, their employers required them to sign, as a condition of employment, arbitration agreements banning collective judicial and arbitral proceedings of any kind. The question presented: Does the Federal Arbitration Act permit employers to insist that their employees, whenever seeking redress for commonly experienced wage loss, go it alone, never mind the right secured to employees by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) “to engage in. . . . concerted activities” for their “mutual aid or protection"? The answer should be a resounding “No.”</p>
<p id="c0d5aee2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the NLRA and its forerunner, the Norris-LaGuardia Act (NLGA), 29 U.S.C. §101 <i>et seq.</i>, Congress acted on an acute awareness: For workers striving to gain from their employers decent terms and conditions of employment, there is strength in numbers. A single employee, Congress understood, is disarmed in dealing with an employer. The Court today subordinates employee-protective labor legislation to the Arbitration Act. In so doing, the Court forgets the labor market imbalance that gave rise to the NLGA and the NLRA, and ignores the destructive consequences of diminishing the right of employees “to band together in confronting an employer.” Congressional correction of the Court’s elevation of the FAA over workers’ rights to act in concert is urgently in order.</p>
<p id="c0d5aee3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To explain why the Court’s decision is egregiously wrong, I first refer to the extreme imbalance once prevalent in our Nation’s workplaces, and Congress’ aim in the NLGA and the NLRA to place employers and employees on a more equal footing. I then explain why the Arbitration Act, sensibly read, does not shrink the NLRA’s protective sphere. . . . </p>

Under economic conditions then prevailing, workers often had to accept employment on whatever terms employers dictated.

<p id="c0d5d5f5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Early legislative efforts to protect workers’ rights to band together were unavailing . . . </p>
<p id="c0d5d5f6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the 1930’s, legislative efforts to safeguard vulnerable workers found more receptive audiences. As the Great Depression shifted political winds further in favor of worker-protective laws, Congress passed two statutes aimed at protecting employees’ associational rights. First, in 1932, Congress passed the NLGA, which regulates the employer-employee relationship indirectly. Section 2 of the Act declares:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0d5d5f7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Whereas. . . . the individual unorganized worker is commonly helpless to exercise actual liberty of contract and to protect his freedom of labor,. . . . it is necessary that he have full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his own choosing,. . . . and that he shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers. . . . in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.” 29 U.S.C. §102. . . . </p>
</div>
<p id="c0d5d5f8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But Congress did so three years later, in 1935, when it enacted the NLRA. Relevant here, §7 of the NLRA guarantees employees “the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, <i>and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection</i>.” 29 U.S.C. §157 (emphasis added). Section 8(a)(1) safeguards those rights by making it an “unfair labor practice” for an employer to “interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in [§7].” §158(a)(1). . . . </p>
<p id="c0d5d5f9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the NLRA’s prohibitions, the employers in the cases now before the Court required their employees to sign contracts stipulating to submission of wage and hours claims to binding arbitration, and to do so only one-by-one. When employees subsequently filed wage and hours claims in federal court and sought to invoke the collective-litigation procedures provided for in the FLSA and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the employers moved to compel individual arbitration. The Arbitration Act, in their view, requires courts to enforce their take-it-or-leave-it arbitration agreements as written, including the collective-litigation abstinence demanded therein.</p>
<p id="c0d5d5fa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In resisting enforcement of the group-action foreclosures, the employees involved in this litigation do not urge that they must have access to a judicial forum. They argue only that the NLRA prohibits their employers from denying them the right to pursue work-related claims in concert in any forum. If they may be stopped by employer-dictated terms from pursuing collective procedures in court, they maintain, they must at least have access to similar procedures in an arbitral forum. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d5d5fb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suits to enforce workplace rights collectively fit comfortably under the umbrella “concerted activities for the purpose of. . . . mutual aid or protection.” 29 U.S.C. §157. “Concerted” means “[p]lanned or accomplished together; combined.” American Heritage Dictionary 381 (5th ed. 2011). “Mutual” means “reciprocal.” <i>Id.,</i> at 1163. When employees meet the requirements for litigation of shared legal claims in <span title="565" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-565">p. 565</span>joint, collective, and class proceedings, the litigation of their claims is undoubtedly “accomplished together.” By joining hands in litigation, workers can spread the costs of litigation and reduce the risk of employer retaliation. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d5d5fc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In face of the NLRA’s text, history, purposes, and longstanding construction, the Court nevertheless concludes that collective proceedings do not fall within the scope of §7.

<p id="c0d5d5fd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The inevitable result of today’s decision will be the underenforcement of federal and state statutes designed to advance the well-being of vulnerable workers. . . . </p>

But the edict that employees with wage and hours claims may seek relief only one-by-one does not come from Congress. It is the result of take-it-or-leave-it labor contracts harking back to the type called “yellow dog,” and of the readiness of this Court to enforce those unbargained-for agreements. The FAA demands no such suppression of the right of workers to take concerted action for their “mutual aid or protection.” Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit in No. 16-307 and affirm the judgments of the Seventh and Ninth Circuits in Nos. 16-285 and 16-300.</p>

For the dissent, that statute merely removed hostility to the enforcement of arbitration clauses, hostility said to have been embedded in state law. For the majority, the FAA went further—not just permitting but <i>encouraging</i> arbitration, and in close cases it should be read to achieve that goal. It’s fair to say that most of the academic commentary embraces the dissent’s view of FAA history, but the Supreme Court gets the last word here.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0d62424-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At a third level down, the Court faced a very difficult problem: that of deciding how several Congresses (that had passed first the FAA and then the pair of labor statutes involved) would have felt about class action waivers. The class action technically existed at the time of these statutes but had taken nothing like its present form—which it assumed only in 1966 with the amendment of Rule 23. Would the Congresses that passed these statutes have smiled or frowned upon the use of collective litigation to enforce the wage statutes, and would they have smiled or frowned upon the use of arbitration clauses to avoid such collective litigation?</p></li>

If the reasons that some have advanced to support the use of arbitration in the consumer context—that it is simpler and cheaper than litigation—are correct, it is surprising that public companies do not seek these advantages in disputes among themselves.

<p id="c0d67251-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Screenwriting credits—the names that scroll on the screen at the start or end of a film or similar production—can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in future writing engagements as well as a larger share of profits from screenings, DVDs, and online sales. Writers, directors, and producers of such entertainment sometimes disagree about who should get credit. Writers have a union—called in Hollywood parlance a “guild"—that has worked out a way of arbitrating such credits when there is a disagreement. As a case described it:</p>

<p id="c0d67252-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The basic agreement contains, in a section entitled theatrical schedule A, detailed provisions concerning writing credits for feature-length theatrical photo-plays. Under schedule A, the production company must notify all participating writers of its tentative credits determination. Any of the writers may then file with the production company and the Writers Guild a written request for arbitration of credits. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d67253-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The credits manual, discussed below, sets forth the procedures the Writers Guild has adopted. . . . The credit arbitration is administered by the Writers Guild’s credit arbitration secretary. When a credit arbitration is requested, this officer sends the parties to the arbitration a screen arbiter’s list, containing the names of all potential arbitrators. These are Writers Guild members with credit arbitration experience or with at least three screenplay credits of their own. This list comprised at least 400 names in 1987. Each party can peremptorily disqualify a reasonable number of persons from the list. From the remaining potential arbitrators, the secretary selects three, endeavoring to select individuals experienced in the type of writing involved in the particular case.</p>
<p id="c0d67254-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The secretary delivers to the three arbitrators all script, outline, and story material prepared or used in the creation of the screenplay, together with source material (writings upon which the screenplay or story is based). These documents are supplied to the Writers Guild by the production company, and each participant in the credit arbitration may examine them to assure the inclusion of everything he or she has written. Any dispute over the “authenticity, identification, sequence, authorship or completeness” of literary material to be included is resolved by a special three-member committee, which conducts for that purpose a prearbitration hearing, at which all affected writers may present testimony and other evidence.</p>
<p id="c0d67255-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The arbitrators also receive the production company’s statement of tentative credits; a copy of the credits manual; and the statements of the parties, which are confidential.

<p id="c0d67256-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The three arbitrators hold no hearing, and they deliberate independently of each other. Indeed, each remains unaware of the identity of the other two (unless, after they reach their decisions, the consultant convenes a meeting with the three). Each arbitrator notifies the secretary of his or her determination. The secretary then informs the parties of the decision of the majority of the arbitrators.</p>
<p id="c0d67257-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Within 24 hours thereafter, any party may request the convening of a policy review board, consisting of three members of the Writers Guild’s credits committee including that committee’s chairman or vice-chairman. The policy review board does not examine the script, story, or source material; indeed, its members are forbidden to read these. Its function is solely to detect any substantial deviation from the policy of the Writers Guild or from the procedure set forth in the credits manual. The policy review board has authority to direct the arbitration committee to reconsider the case or to order a fresh arbitration by a new triumvirate. The policy review board is not empowered to reverse the decision of an arbitration committee in matters of judgment. A decision of the policy review board approving a credit determination is final.</p>

What about arbitrators’ awards? The general proposition is that appeal to a court is possible but not generally useful because the court will narrowly restrict the scope of its review: Was the arbitrator bribed or did the procedure violate fundamental fairness? For some parties the inability to appeal an arbitration award is an advantage: It eliminates a source of delay. For others, it is a disadvantage: It puts the parties at the mercy of an arbitrator who may be interpreting a new statute or an especially unusual contract.</p>

<p id="c0d6996f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose there is no arbitration agreement, or that it is unenforceable. Litigation ensues. Your client is open to settlement, but negotiations prove fruitless. Or your client wants something that only adjudication can deliver—for example, a binding public declaration of rights. Is trial inevitable? No. A court can grant summary judgment in cases in which there is no material factual dispute. The key provision, in Rule 56(a), provides that “the court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Courts interpret this provision to mean that summary judgment should be granted if, given the evidence presented, no reasonable jury could find for the nonmoving party. Summary judgment may be appropriate because the critical dispute concerns the law—does the First Amendment forbid a school district from requiring pupils to recite the Pledge of Allegiance? Or summary judgment may be appropriate in a case where the law was clear but one party lacked evidence supporting a critical element of her case. In either circumstance, trial is pointless because no reasonable jury could find for one side or the other. This section explores the possibilities and limits of summary judgment.</p>

At that point the plaintiff will rest his case. Unless the defendant changes his story from that revealed in his responses to requests for admission, he has no defense because he acknowledges having signed the note and does not claim to have repaid it.

So long as there is a material factual dispute, a court should leave it to a jury to resolve.</p></li>

<p id="c0d6e7af-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having considered the role of summary judgment and the ways in which parties seek and defend against summary judgment motions, we turn to the application of the summary judgment standard. Just as the standards of pleading have changed in recent years, the standards for summary judgment have shifted since the initial promulgation of the Rules. Before 1938, summary judgment was available only under limited circumstances; the Federal Rules promulgated in 1938 made summary judgment available to all parties and claims. It was, though, used sparingly by judges, who may have perceived summary judgment as infringing on parties’ right to a trial. In three cases decided in 1986—<i>Celotex</i>, <i>Anderson</i>, and <i>Matsushita</i>—the Supreme Court interpreted the summary judgment standard in ways that gave courts broader authority to grant summary judgment. Since 1986, parties—usually though not always defendants—have brought summary judgment motions with increasing frequency. Today, more cases end at summary judgment than at trial. In the remainder of this chapter, we will consider the impact of each of these cases on summary judgment practice.</p>
<p id="c0d6e7b0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first, <i>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett</i>, focuses on what the party moving for summary judgment must do, in the absence of any opposition, to justify a court’s granting its motion. Before <i>Celotex</i>, the leading case on federal summary judgment was Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. 144 (1970). <i>Adickes</i> grew out of a civil rights demonstration in which plaintiff, refused service at a racially segregated lunch counter, sued the restaurant owner. At the time, the federal public accommodations laws provided no damages remedy for private discrimination, and the liability of the business therefore depended on whether it had acted in concert with the local authorities, thereby fulfilling the state action requirement of 42 U.S.C. §1983. All agreed that there had been a police officer in the store at the time service was refused, but plaintiff produced no evidence showing communication between the officer and any store employee. The defendant submitted affidavits and deposition transcripts from the store manager and the police officer that they had not communicated with each other and that the manager had refused service because he was concerned about “a riot.” The Supreme Court said: “Our own scrutiny of the factual allegations of petitioner’s complaint, as well as the material found in the affidavits and depositions presented by Kress to the District Court, however, convinces us that summary judgment was improper here, for we think <i>respondent</i> [the defendant store] <i>failed to carry its burden of <span title="573" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-573">p. 573</span>showing the absence of any genuine</i> issue of fact.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A84_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10A84_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">6</a></span> Id. at 153 (emphasis added). After reviewing the evidence presented at the motion for summary judgment the Court summarized:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0d6e7b2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think that on the basis of this record, it was error to grant summary judgment. As the moving party, respondent had the burden of showing the absence of a genuine issue as to any material fact, and for these purposes the material it lodged must be viewed in the light most favorable to the opposing party. Respondent here did not carry its burden because of its failure to <i>foreclose the possibility</i> that there was a policeman in the Kress store while petitioner was awaiting service, and that this policeman reached an understanding with some Kress employee that petitioner not be served.</p>

<p id="c0d70eca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . Respondent commenced this lawsuit in September 1980, alleging that the death. . . . of her husband. . . . resulted from his exposure to products containing asbestos manufactured or distributed by 15 named corporations. . . . Petitioner’s motion [for summary judgment]. . . . argued that summary judgment was proper because respondent had “failed to produce evidence that any [Celotex] product. . . . was the proximate cause of the injuries allege. . . . ” In particular, petitioner noted that respondent had failed to identify, in answering interrogatories specifically requesting such information, any witnesses who could testify about the decedent’s exposure to petitioner’s asbestos products. In response to petitioner’s summary judgment motion, respondent then produced three documents which she claimed “demonstrate that there is a genuine material factual dispute” as to whether the decedent had ever been exposed to petitioner’s asbestos products. The three documents included a transcript of a deposition of the decedent, a letter from an official of one of the decedent’s former employers whom petitioner planned to call as a trial witness, and a letter from an insurance company to respondent’s attorney, all tending to establish that the decedent had been exposed to petitioner’s asbestos products in Chicago. <span title="574" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-574">p. 574</span>Petitioner, in turn, argued that the three documents were inadmissible hearsay and thus could not be considered in opposition to the summary judgment motion.</p>
<p id="c0d70ecb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . The District Court granted. . . . the motion. . . . because “there [was] no showing that the plaintiff was exposed to the defendant Celotex’s product in the District of Columbia or elsewhere within the statutory period.” [The court of appeals reversed.] According to the majority, Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and this Court’s decision in Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. 144, 159 (1970), establish that “the party opposing the motion for summary judgment bears the burden of responding <i>only after</i> the moving party has met its burden of coming forward with proof of the absence of any genuine issues of material fact.” 244 U.S. App. D.C., at 163, 756 F.2d, at 184 (emphasis in original; footnote omitted). The majority therefore declined to consider petitioner’s argument that none of the evidence produced by respondent in opposition to the motion for summary judgment would have been admissible at trial.</p>
<p id="c0d70ecc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . We think that the position taken by the majority of the Court of Appeals is inconsistent with the standard for summary judgment set forth in Rule 56[(a)] of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. . . . In our view, the plain language of Rule 56[(a)] mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery. . . . against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. In such a situation, there can be “no genuine [dispute] as to any material fact,” since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party’s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. The moving party is “entitled to judgment as a matter of law” because the nonmoving party has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with respect to which she has the burden of proof. “[The] standard [for granting summary judgment] mirrors the standard for a directed verdict under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a. . . . ” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 250 (1986).</p>
<p id="c0d70ecd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, a party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of ["particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations. . . . admissions, interrogatory answers [quoting Rule 56(c)(1)]"] which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine [dispute]. But unlike the Court of Appeals, we find no express or implied requirement in Rule 56 that the moving party support its motions with affidavits or other similar materials <i>negating</i> the opponent’s claim. On the contrary, Rule 56(c), which refers to “pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admission on file, together with the affidavits if <i>any</i>”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10AFF_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10AFF_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">7</a></span> (emphasis added), suggests the absence of such a requirement. . . . One of the principal purposes of the summary judgment rule is to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims or defenses, and we think it should be interpreted in a way that enables it to accomplish this purpose. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d70ecf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="575" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-575">p. 575</span>We do not mean that the nonmoving party must produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial in order to avoid summary judgment. Obviously, Rule 56 does not require the nonmoving party to depose her own witness. Rule 56[(a)] permits a proper summary judgment motion to be opposed by any of the kinds of evidentiary materials listed in Rule 56(c), except the mere pleadings themselves. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d70ed0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals in this case felt itself constrained, however, by language in Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. 144 (1970). There we held that summary judgment had been improperly entered in favor of the defendant. . . . <i>Adickes</i>. . . . said. . . . “both the commentary on and the background of the 1963 Amendment conclusively show that it was not intended to modify the burden of the moving party. . . . to show initially the absence of a genuine issue concerning any material fact.” We think that this statement is accurate in a literal sense. . . . But we do not think the <i>Adickes</i> language quoted above should be construed to mean that the burden is on the party moving for summary judgment to produce evidence showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, even with respect to an issue on which the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof. Instead, as we have explained, the burden on the moving party may be discharged by “showing"—that is, pointing out to the District Court—that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d735e1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our conclusion is bolstered by the fact that district courts are widely acknowledged to possess the power to enter summary judgments sua sponte, so long as the losing party was on notice that she had to come forward with all of her evidence. It would surely defy common sense to hold that the District Court could have entered summary judgment sua sponte in favor of petitioner in the instant case, but that petitioner’s filing of a motion requesting such a disposition precluded the District Court from ordering it.</p>
<p id="c0d735e2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent commenced this action in September 1980, and petitioner’s motion was filed in September 1981. The parties had conducted discovery, and no serious claim can be made that the respondent was in any sense “railroaded” by a premature motion for summary judgment. Any potential problem with such premature motions can be adequately dealt with under Rule 56[(d)], which allows a summary judgment motion to be denied, or the hearing on the motion to be continued, if the nonmoving party has not had an opportunity to make full discovery.</p>
<p id="c0d735e3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this Court, respondent’s brief and oral argument have been devoted as much to the proposition that an adequate showing of exposure to petitioner’s asbestos products was made as to the proposition that no such showing should have been required. But the Court of Appeals declined to address either. . . . We think the Court of Appeals. . . . is better suited than we are to make these determinations in the first instance. . . . Summary judgment procedure is properly regarded not as a disfavored procedural shortcut, but rather as an integral part of the Federal Rules as a whole, which are designed “to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1. Before the shift to “notice pleading” accomplished by the Federal Rules, motions to dismiss a complaint or to strike a defense were the principal tools by which factually insufficient claims or defenses could be isolated and prevented from going to trial. . . . But with the advent of “notice pleading,” the motion to dismiss seldom fulfills this function any more, and its place has been taken by the motion for summary judgment. . . . </p>

Respondent, on the other hand, does not contend that she was not obligated to reveal her witnesses and evidence but insists that she has revealed enough to defeat the motion for summary judgment.

</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d75d03-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What did <i>Celotex</i> do to summary judgment standards? Why does it matter? One way of understanding the answers to these questions is to consider the burdens on the parties at trial. At trial, Celotex, the defendant, could prevail in two ways. It could prove that Mr. Catrett was not exposed to its asbestos by demonstrating that neither it nor its predecessor companies had ever manufactured asbestos—unlikely given that asbestos was a principal part of its business at that time. Or it could prevail if Mrs. Catrett <i>failed to show</i> that Mr. Catrett was exposed to its asbestos, perhaps by convincing a jury that the sole testimony linking Mr. Catrett to Celotex asbestos was not credible because the witness had been bribed.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0d75d06-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to <i>Celotex</i>, the defendant Celotex can certainly win its summary judgment motion by showing that Mr. Catrett was not exposed to its product. That is no news: <i>Adickes</i> had said as much. Can Celotex also win by showing that Mrs. Catrett has failed to show that Mr. Catrett was exposed? The answer in <i>Adickes</i> was no.

<li class=""><p id="c0d7841b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Celotex</i> focuses on the state of evidence at the time of summary judgment: It will not suffice for the party resisting summary judgment to say, “I’m planning to look into that before trial, and I’m sure I’ll come up with evidence on that point.” Unless the party can show that it has had insufficient time for discovery, it will lose.

<p id="c0d7841e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Celotex</i> is about summary judgment. But both in the federal courts and in the state courts that have taken the same path, it will affect how and when parties use discovery. Before <i>Celotex</i>, a party with the burden of production at trial could wait until quite late in the pretrial stage to assemble all its evidence, resting fairly secure in the knowledge that it would be very difficult for the opposing party to <i>disprove</i> the claim or defense. After <i>Celotex</i>, waiting until just before trial to assemble the evidence will be too late: If the basic evidence supporting your claim or defense is not available at the summary judgment stage, you lose.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0d7841f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice the <i>Celotex</i> formulation: The party that will have the burden of proof at trial has the equivalent burden at summary judgment—the burden of “mak[ing] a showing” of evidence sufficient to let a rational trier of fact find in its favor. This alignment of burdens at summary judgment with burdens at trial means that the standard for summary judgment will apply differently depending on which party is moving for summary judgment. To see this point, suppose that one of the issues in contention is whether asbestosis (as opposed to some other disease) caused Mr. Catrett’s death. Mrs. Catrett’s complaint alleges that asbestosis caused her husband’s death; Celotex denies that allegation in its answer. Mrs. Catrett as the plaintiff will have the burden of proof at trial on that issue.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0d78420-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First suppose that Celotex, the defendant, moves for summary judgment on this issue of causation. In its supporting papers, it points out that no medically qualified expert has opined that asbestosis caused Mr. Catrett’s death. In her response, Mrs. Catrett produces the affidavit of a pathologist who recites his professional qualifications, describes his examination of the relevant tissue samples, and comes to the conclusion that the laboratory findings are “consistent with Mr. Catrett’s having died as a result of asbestosis.” Explain why the court should deny Celotex’s motion for summary judgment.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d78421-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now suppose that it is Mrs. Catrett, not Celotex, who moves for summary judgment on the issue of causation. In support of this motion she produces the same affidavit. In response, Celotex produces no affidavit or other evidence contradicting plaintiff’s expert.

<li class=""><p id="c0d78422-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why does the same affidavit lead to the same result (denial of summary judgment) even though different parties are moving for summary judgment?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0d78423-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court in <i>Celotex</i> did not actually decide who should prevail on the defendant’s motion for summary judgment. It contented itself instead with setting out a new standard for summary judgment and remanding for the lower courts to decide the case using that new standard. Suppose that Celotex had made an adequate initial showing under that new standard to justify the grant of summary judgment—unless plaintiff in response produced evidence that would entitle a rational trier of fact to find in her favor.

The Court in <i>Anderson</i> explained that “summary judgment will not lie if the dispute about a material fact is ’genuine,’ that is, if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party” and that, in making this assessment, “[t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.” The Court in <i>Matsushita</i> gave district courts discretion to assess the plausibility of the parties’ contentions and grant summary judgment if the nonmoving party could show only “some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.” Consider the ways in which the next two decisions interpret and apply these standards.</p>

At the time of the shooting, Tolan was unarmed on his parents’ front porch about 15 to 20 feet away from Cotton. Tolan sued, alleging that Cotton had exercised excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The District Court granted summary judgment to Cotton. In articulating the factual context of the case, the Fifth Circuit failed to adhere to the axiom that in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, “[t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.” Anderson v.

<p id="c0d7ab3f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The following facts, which we view in the light most favorable to Tolan, are taken from the record evidence and the opinions below. At around 2:00 on the morning of December 31, 2008, John Edwards, a police officer, was on patrol in Bellaire, Texas, when he noticed a black Nissan sport utility vehicle turning quickly onto a residential <span title="580" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-580">p. 580</span>street. The officer watched the vehicle park on the side of the street in front of a house. Two men exited: Tolan and his cousin, Anthony Cooper.</p>
<p id="c0d7ab40-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Edwards attempted to enter the license plate number of the vehicle into a computer in his squad car. But he keyed an incorrect character; instead of entering plate number 696BGK, he entered 695BGK. That incorrect number matched a stolen vehicle of the same color and make. This match caused the squad car’s computer to send an automatic message to other police units, informing them that Edwards had found a stolen vehicle.</p>
<p id="c0d7ab41-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Edwards exited his cruiser, drew his service pistol and ordered Tolan and Cooper to the ground. He accused Tolan and Cooper of having stolen the car. Cooper responded, “That’s not true.” And Tolan explained, “That’s my car.” Tolan then complied with the officer’s demand to lie face-down on the home’s front porch.</p>
<p id="c0d7ab42-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As it turned out, Tolan and Cooper were at the home where Tolan lived with his parents. Hearing the commotion, Tolan’s parents exited the front door in their pajamas. In an attempt to keep the misunderstanding from escalating into something more, Tolan’s father instructed Cooper to lie down, and instructed Tolan and Cooper to say nothing. Tolan and Cooper then remained face-down.</p>
<p id="c0d7ab43-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Edwards told Tolan’s parents that he believed Tolan and Cooper had stolen the vehicle. In response, Tolan’s father identified Tolan as his son, and Tolan’s mother explained that the vehicle belonged to the family and that no crime had been committed. Tolan’s father explained, with his hands in the air, “[T]his is my nephew. This is my son. We live here. This is my house.” Tolan’s mother similarly offered, “[S]ir this is a big mistake. This car is not stolen. . . . That’s our car.”</p>
<p id="c0d7ab44-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While Tolan and Cooper continued to lie on the ground in silence, Edwards radioed for assistance. Shortly thereafter, Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton arrived on the scene and drew his pistol. Edwards told Cotton that Cooper and Tolan had exited a stolen vehicle. Tolan’s mother reiterated that she and her husband owned both the car Tolan had been driving and the home where these events were unfolding. Cotton then ordered her to stand against the family’s garage door. In response to Cotton’s order, Tolan’s mother asked, “[A]re you kidding me? We’ve lived her[e] 15 years. We’ve never had anything like this happen before.”</p>
<p id="c0d7ab45-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties disagree as to what happened next. Tolan’s mother and Cooper testified during Cotton’s criminal trial that Cotton grabbed her arm and slammed her against the garage door with such force that she fell to the ground. Tolan similarly testified that Cotton pushed his mother against the garage door. In addition, Tolan offered testimony from his mother and photographic evidence to demonstrate that Cotton used enough force to leave bruises on her arms and back that lasted for days. By contrast, Cotton testified in his deposition that when he was escorting the mother to the garage, she flipped her arm up and told him to get his hands off her. He also testified that he did not know whether he left bruises but believed that he had not.</p>
<p id="c0d7ab46-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties also dispute the manner in which Tolan responded. Tolan testified in his deposition and during the criminal trial that upon seeing his mother being pushed, he rose to his knees. Edwards and Cotton testified that Tolan rose to his feet.</p>
<p id="c0d7d257-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both parties agree that Tolan then exclaimed, from roughly 15 to 20 feet away, “[G]et your fucking hands off my mom.” The parties also agree that Cotton then drew <span title="581" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-581">p. 581</span>his pistol and fired three shots at Tolan. Tolan and his mother testified that these shots came with no verbal warning. One of the bullets entered Tolan’s chest, collapsing his right lung and piercing his liver. While Tolan survived, he suffered a life-altering injury that disrupted his budding professional baseball career and causes him to experience pain on a daily basis.</p>

<p id="c0d7d259-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In May 2009, Cooper, Tolan, and Tolan’s parents filed this suit in the Southern District of Texas, alleging claims under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U.S.C. §1983. Tolan claimed, among other things, that Cotton had used excessive force against him in violation of the Fourth Amendment. After discovery, Cotton moved for summary judgment.</p>
<p id="c0d7d25a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court granted summary judgment to Cotton. It reasoned that Cotton’s use of force was not unreasonable and therefore did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The Fifth Circuit affirmed.</p>
<p id="c0d7d25b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reaching this conclusion, the Fifth Circuit began by noting that at the time Cotton shot Tolan, “it was. . . . clearly established that an officer had the right to use deadly force if that officer harbored an objective and reasonable belief that a suspect presented an ’immediate threat to [his] safety.’” The Court of Appeals reasoned that Tolan failed to overcome th[at] bar because “an objectively-reasonable officer in Sergeant Cotton’s position could have. . . . believed” that Tolan “presented an ’immediate threat to the safety of the officers.’” In support of this conclusion, the court relied on the following facts: the front porch had been “dimly-lit”; Tolan’s mother had “refus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm”; and Tolan’s words had amounted to a “verba[l] threa[t].” Most critically, the court also relied on the purported fact that Tolan was “moving to intervene in” Cotton’s handling of his mother, and that Cotton therefore could reasonably have feared for his life. Accordingly, the court held, Cotton did not violate clearly established law in shooting Tolan. . . . </p>

<p id="c0d7d25e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In holding that Cotton’s actions did not violate clearly established law, the Fifth Circuit failed to view the evidence at summary judgment in the light most favorable to Tolan with respect to the central facts of this case. By failing to credit evidence that contradicted some of its key factual conclusions, the court improperly “weigh[ed] the evidence” and resolved disputed issues in favor of the moving party, <i>Anderson</i>, 477 U.S., at 249.</p>
<p id="c0d7d25f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the court relied on its view that at the time of the shooting, the Tolans’ front porch was “dimly-lit.” The court appears to have drawn this assessment from Cotton’s statements in a deposition that when he fired at Tolan, the porch was “’fairly dark,’” and lit by a gas lamp that was “’decorative.’” In his own deposition, however, Tolan’s father was asked whether the gas lamp was in fact “more decorative than illuminating.” He said that it was not. Moreover, Tolan stated in his deposition that two <span title="582" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-582">p. 582</span>floodlights shone on the driveway during the incident, and Cotton acknowledged that there were two motion-activated lights in front of the house. And Tolan confirmed that at the time of the shooting, he was “not in darkness.”</p>
<p id="c0d7d260-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the Fifth Circuit stated that Tolan’s mother “refus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm,” thereby “compound[ing]” Cotton’s belief that Tolan “presented an immediate threat to the safety of the officers.” But here, too, the court did not credit directly contradictory evidence. Although the parties agree that Tolan’s mother repeatedly informed officers that Tolan was her son, that she lived in the home in front of which he had parked, and that the vehicle he had been driving belonged to her and her husband, there is a dispute as to how calmly she provided this information. Cotton stated during his deposition that Tolan’s mother was “very agitated” when she spoke to the officers. By contrast, Tolan’s mother testified at Cotton’s criminal trial that she was neither “aggravated” nor “agitated.”</p>
<p id="c0d7d261-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the Court concluded that Tolan was “shouting,” and “verbally threatening” the officer, in the moments before the shooting. The court noted, and the parties agree, that while Cotton was grabbing the arm of his mother, Tolan told Cotton, “[G]et your fucking hands off my mom.” But Tolan testified that he “was not screaming.” And a jury could reasonably infer that his words, in context, did not amount to a statement of intent to inflict harm. Tolan’s mother testified in Cotton’s criminal trial that he slammed her against a garage door with enough force to cause bruising that lasted for days. A jury could well have concluded that a reasonable officer would have heard Tolan’s words not as a threat, but as a son’s plea not to continue any assault of his mother.</p>
<p id="c0d7d262-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fourth, the Fifth Circuit inferred that at the time of the shooting, Tolan was “moving to intervene in Sergeant Cotton’s” interaction with his mother. The court appears to have credited Edwards’ account that at the time of the shooting, Tolan was on both feet “[i]n a crouch” or a “charging position” looking as if he was going to move forward. Tolan testified at trial, however, that he was on his knees when Cotton shot him, a fact corroborated by his mother. Tolan also testified in his deposition that he “wasn’t going anywhere,” and emphasized that he did not “jump up.”</p>
<p id="c0d7d263-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Considered together, these facts lead to the inescapable conclusion that the court below credited the evidence of the party seeking summary judgment and failed properly to acknowledge key evidence offered by the party opposing that motion. And while “this Court is not equipped to correct every perceived error coming from the lower federal courts,” Boag v. MacDougall, 454 U.S. 364, 366 (1982) (O’Connor, J., concurring), we intervene here because the opinion below reflects a clear misapprehension of summary judgment standards in light of our precedents.</p>
<p id="c0d7d264-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The witnesses on both sides come to this case with their own perceptions, recollections, and even potential biases. It is in part for that reason that genuine disputes are generally resolved by juries in our adversarial system. By weighing the evidence and reaching factual inferences contrary to Tolan’s competent evidence, the court below neglected to adhere to the fundamental principle that at the summary judgment stage, reasonable inferences should be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party.</p>
<p id="c0d7d265-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying that principle here, the court should have acknowledged and credited Tolan’s evidence with regard to the lighting, his mother’s demeanor, whether he <span title="583" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-583">p. 583</span>shouted words that were an overt threat, and his positioning during the shooting. . . . The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

<p id="c0d7f982-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case arises out of the tragic death from cocaine intoxication of University of Maryland basketball star Leonard K. Bias (“Bias”). James Bias, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Leonard K. Bias, deceased (“the Estate”), appeals an order of the District Court for the District of Columbia which granted summary judgment to defendants Advantage International, Inc. (“Advantage”) and A.

<p id="c0d7f984-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On April 7, 1986, after the close of his college basketball career, Bias entered into a representation agreement with Advantage whereby Advantage agreed to advise and represent Bias in his affairs. Fentress was the particular Advantage representative servicing the Bias account. On June 17 of that year Bias was picked by the Boston Celtics in the first round of the National Basketball Association draft. On the morning of <span title="584" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-584">p. 584</span>June 19, 1986, Bias died of cocaine intoxication. The Estate sued Advantage and Fentress for. . . . injuries allegedly arising out of the representation arrangement between Bias and the defendants.</p>
<p id="c0d7f985-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he Estate alleges that, prior to Bias’s death, Bias and his parents directed Fentress to obtain a one-million dollar life insurance policy on Bias’s life, that Fentress represented to Bias and Bias’s parents that he had secured such a policy, and that in reliance on Fentress’s assurances, Bias’s parents did not independently seek to buy an insurance policy on Bias’s life. . . . [D]efendants. . . . did not secure any life insurance coverage for Bias prior to his death. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d7f986-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court awarded the defendants summary judgment. . . . With respect to the [life insurance] claim, the District Court held, in effect, that the Estate did not suffer any damage from the defendants’ alleged failure to obtain life insurance for Bias because, even if the defendants had tried to obtain a one-million dollar policy on Bias’s life, they would not have been able to do so. The District Court based this conclusion on the facts, about which it found no genuine issue, that Bias was a cocaine user and that no insurer in 1986 would have issued a one-million dollar life insurance policy, or “jumbo” policy, to a cocaine user unless the applicant made a misrepresentation regarding the applicant’s use of drugs, thereby rendering the insurance policy void. . . . </p>

<p id="c0d7f989-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has stated that the moving party always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the record which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <i>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett</i>. The Supreme Court also explained that summary judgment is appropriate, no matter which party is the moving party, where a party fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. Thus, the moving party must explain its reasons for concluding that the record does not reveal any genuine issues of material fact, and must make a showing supporting its claims insofar as those claims involve issues on which it will bear the burden at trial.</p>
<p id="c0d7f98a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once the moving party has carried its burden, the responsibility then shifts to the nonmoving party to show that there is, in fact, a genuine issue of material fact. The Supreme Court has directed that the nonmoving party “must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.” Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio, 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986). The nonmoving party “must come forward with ’specific facts showing that there is a <i>genuine issue for trial.</i>’” (emphasis in original). In evaluating the nonmovant’s proffer, a court must of course draw from the evidence all justifiable inferences in favor of the nonmovant. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986).</p>

<p id="c0d8209c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court’s determination that there was no genuine issue involving Bias’s insurability rests on two subsidiary conclusions: First, the District Court concluded that there was no genuine issue as to the fact that Bias was a drug user. Second, the District Court held that there was no dispute about the fact that as a drug user, Bias could not have obtained a jumbo life insurance policy. We can only affirm the District Court’s award of summary judgment to the defendants on the insurance issue if both of these conclusions were correct.</p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0d8209d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">A. Bias’s Prior Drug Use</p></div>
<p id="c0d8209e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants in this case offered the eyewitness testimony of two former teammates of Bias, Terry Long and David Gregg, in order to show that Bias was a cocaine user during the period prior to his death. Long and Gregg both described numerous occasions when they saw Bias ingest cocaine, and Long testified that he was introduced to cocaine by Bias and that Bias sometimes supplied others with cocaine.</p>
<p id="c0d8209f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although on appeal the Estate attempts to discredit the testimony of Long and Gregg, the Estate did not seek to impeach the testimony of these witnesses before the District Court, and the Estate made no effort to depose these witnesses. Instead, the Estate offered affidavits from each of Bias’s parents stating that Bias was not a drug user; the deposition testimony of Bias’s basketball coach, Charles “Lefty” Driesell, who testified that he knew Bias well for four years and never knew Bias to be a user of drugs at any time prior to his death; and the results of several drug tests administered to Bias during the four years prior to his death which may have shown that, on the occasions when the tests were administered, there were no traces in Bias’s system of the drugs for which he was tested.</p>
<p id="c0d820a0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the Estate’s generalized evidence that Bias was not a drug user did not contradict the more specific testimony of teammates who knew Bias well and had seen him use cocaine on particular occasions, the District Court determined that there was no genuine issue as to the fact that Bias was a drug user. We agree.</p>
<p id="c0d820a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no question that the defendants satisfied their initial burden on the issue of Bias’s drug use. The testimony of Long and Gregg clearly tends to show that Bias was a cocaine user. We also agree with the District Court that the Estate did not rebut the defendants’ showing. The testimony of Bias’s parents to the effect that they knew Bias well and did not know him to be a drug user does not rebut the Long and Gregg testimony about Bias’s drug use on particular occasions. The District Court properly held that rebuttal testimony either must come from persons familiar with the particular events to which the defendants’ witnesses testified or must otherwise cast more than metaphysical doubt on the credibility of that testimony. Bias’s parents and coach did not have personal knowledge of Bias’s activities at the sorts of parties and gatherings about which Long and Gregg testified. The drug test results offered by the Estate may show that Bias had no cocaine in his system on the dates when the tests were administered, but, as the District Court correctly noted, these tests speak only to Bias’s abstention during the periods preceding the tests. The tests do not rebut the <span title="586" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-586">p. 586</span>Long and Gregg testimony that on a number of occasions Bias ingested cocaine in their presence.</p>
<p id="c0d820a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Estate could have deposed Long and Gregg, or otherwise attempted to impeach their testimony. The Estate also could have offered the testimony of other friends or teammates of Bias who were present at some of the gatherings described by Long and Gregg, who went out with Bias frequently, or who were otherwise familiar with his social habits. The Estate did none of these things. The Estate is not entitled to reach the jury merely on the supposition that the jury might not believe the defendants’ witnesses. We thus agree with the District Court that there was no genuine issue of fact concerning Bias’s status as a cocaine user.</p>

<p id="c0d820a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants offered evidence that <i>every</i> insurance company inquires about the prior drug use of an applicant for a jumbo policy at <i>some point</i> in the application process. . . . The Estate’s evidence that some insurance companies existed in 1986 which did not inquire about prior drug use at certain particular stages in the application process does not undermine the defendant’s claim that at <i>some</i> point in the process <i>every</i> insurance company did inquire about drug use, particularly where a jumbo policy was involved. The Estate failed to name a single particular company or provide other evidence that a single company existed which would have issued a jumbo policy in 1986 without inquiring about the applicant’s drug use. Because the Estate has failed to do more than show that there is “some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts,” <i>Matsushita Elec.</i>, the District Court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to the insurability of a drug user. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d820a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to withstand a summary judgment motion once the moving party has made a prima facie showing to support its claims, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). The Estate has failed to come forward with such facts in this case, relying instead on bare arguments and allegations or on evidence which does not actually create a genuine issue for trial. For this reason, we affirm the District Court’s award of summary judgment to the defendants in this case.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0d846c0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The best demonstration of what constitutes a “genuine dispute as to [a] material fact,” as well as of how close the decision in <i>Bias</i> comes to the line, emerges if we think about some variations on the facts of the case. Start by supposing that the sole evidence of drug use presented by the defendants was the testimony of Bias’s friends, who said under oath that they had on several specific dates seen Bias use cocaine. Further suppose that plaintiff had presented evidence of other persons, present at the same times, who unequivocally testified that they had been in Bias’s company the whole time and that he had not used drugs. Explain why summary judgment would not be appropriate.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d846c1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now come closer to the actual case, in which there was testimony that Bias had ingested cocaine on specific dates and that he had provided drugs for others; there was also evidence (the negative drug tests) that he had been drug-free on other days, and that close associates and family did not believe him to have used drugs. Why does this state of evidence not create a similar conflict for a trier of fact to resolve?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d846c2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court’s answer to that question is that the evidence of drug use was specific, while the evidence of non-use was general, and that the specific trumps the general—such that there really isn’t a conflict for the trier to resolve. Suppose that Bias had died when he was struck by a car while crossing the street. Under those circumstances if the defendants had moved for summary judgment by introducing evidence of drug use and arguing that he would not have been able to obtain a life insurance policy, do you suppose the case would have come out the same way? Or would plaintiff have been able to argue, first, that, at worst, defendants’ evidence showed occasional exposure to the drug and, second, that the defendants were trying to avoid their own breach of contract by posthumously smearing the name of a great African-American athlete? Moreover, the defendants were doing so with the testimony of persons who, by their own account, were habitual drug users; shouldn’t Bias’s estate be able to put them on the stand before a jury and probe their veracity?</p></li>

But don’t stop reading: Those suits will end because the parties understand the processes discussed in the next several chapters. One can, therefore, think about those processes in two ways. From one point of view, they will yield results so predictable that parties can settle without regret. From another point of view, they are so unpredictable and so dangerous that parties will settle even strong cases to avoid them. As you read the next chapters, consider which point of view seems closest to the truth.</p>

<p id="c0d8bc15-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q1.</b>  B is the only correct response. Rule 8(c) lists “accord and satisfaction,” the archaic term for settlement, as an affirmative defense. A is wrong: Since accord and satisfaction is an affirmative defense, defendant must raise it. C is wrong because, like oral contracts of other sorts, an oral settlement agreement is perfectly valid; because it will be harder to prove, prudence suggests getting these agreements written down, but that’s a matter of prudence, not legal validity. D is wrong because judicial approval of settlements is not required except in a few types of cases—those involving minors or incompetent persons and those involving class actions.</p>
<p id="c0d8bc16-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q2.</b>  A and C are the correct responses. A is correct because mediation is assisted negotiation. C is correct because even if the parties cannot agree on settlement terms (the unsuccessful mediation), they might be able to agree on a process to resolve the dispute (arbitration). B is wrong because if arbitration is successful, the dispute settles and there would be nothing for a mediator to decide. D is wrong because parties can decide at any point during—or before—litigation to mediate or arbitrate their claims.</p>
<p id="c0d8bc17-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q3.</b>  A and C are the correct responses. A is correct because the Federal Arbitration Act, which governs arbitration agreements, preempts state law, providing that arbitration agreements may be avoided only on grounds applicable to <i>all</i> contracts; this statute, which singles out arbitration in employment agreements, fails the test of being generally applicable to all contracts. C is correct for the converse reason: If this agreement fails under the state’s general law of unconscionability, courts may refuse to enforce it, but not otherwise. B is wrong for the same reasons listed under A. D is wrong because the FAA governs all agreements to arbitrate involving “commerce,” which has been very broadly interpreted—including state law claims.</p>
<p id="c0d8bc18-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4.</b>  A and B are correct. They are correct because the <i>plaintiff</i> has the burden of production on the question of causation, and if the evidence to date hasn’t yielded such evidence, after <i>Celotex</i> defendant wins on this showing. B is correct because the burdens of production are reversed: <i>Defendant</i> has the burden of production on an affirmative defense and can prevail only by making a positive showing that the statute has run. C is wrong because A and B are correct.</p>
<p id="c0d8bc19-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q5.</b>  A and C are correct. A is correct because <i>Celotex</i> tells judges to view the evidence presented as of the time of summary judgment and to grant summary judgment if the party with the burden of production has not collected and presented enough evidence to allow a rational trier of fact to find in its favor. That instruction tells parties with the burden of production that they must be able to present such a collection of evidence at the moment of summary judgment—and thus makes it critical to deploy available discovery tools to gather that evidence. C is correct because <i>Anderson</i> tells us so—at summary judgment, evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving <span title="591" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-591">p. 591</span>party. The district court and Fifth Circuit did not do so in <i>Tolan v. Cotton</i> and were reversed as a result. B is incorrect because the party opposing summary judgment has not avoided judgment simply by presenting evidence in her opposition. Instead, that evidence must create a material factual dispute. In the <i>Bias</i> case, both sides did offer evidence supporting their claims, but the court found that the information offered by the plaintiff in opposition to defendants’ summary judgment motion did not create a factual dispute.</p><span title="592" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-592">p. 592</span>

Parties to arbitration are often charged two or three thousand dollars per day in arbitration “forum fees,” since arbitrators typically charge $300-400 per hour. We are concerned by the significant deterrent effect that such fees will have on employees who are required to arbitrate their civil rights claims. [In a subsequent footnote, the court added: “Our conclusion that Countrywide’s fee provision is unconscionable is not affected by the fact that, under Countrywide’s arbitration agreement, ’the arbitrator may in his or her discretion permit the prevailing party to recover fees and costs.’ As is clear on its face, this provision is <i>discretionary</i> and, therefore, there is no guarantee that the prevailing party will, in fact, recover fees. Moreover, the significant up-front costs associated with bringing a claim in an arbitral forum may prevent individuals with meritorious claims from even pursuing these claims in the first place."]</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c0d6e7b1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="#ftN10A84_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" id="note-N10A84_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">6</a></span>&nbsp;[The quoted language constituted the text of Rule 56 at the time <i>Adickes</i> was decided.
