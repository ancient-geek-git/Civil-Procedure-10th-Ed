<p id="c0c66cf1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A hundred years ago, if a complaint survived a motion to dismiss, the case would go to trial if the plaintiff wanted it to. That is no longer true. In contemporary litigation the chief significance of a complaint’s surviving dismissal is that it enables the plaintiff to reach the “pretrial” stage—the intermediate stage between pleading and trial. Today most lawsuits end at this pretrial stage. In part they end at this stage because of the procedural device explored in this chapter—discovery. Discovery ends lawsuits for two reasons. First, discovery produces information about the merits of the lawsuit and permits parties to make informed judgments about the strength of their and their opponent’s positions. Such information can hasten a lawsuit’s end either through settlement or summary judgment, both explored in the next chapter. Second, because discovery costs time and money, it might enable one party simply to wear the other down—or both sides to wear each other down—without regard to the merits of the case. This chapter explains why discovery has both these potentials and explores how the Rules try to maximize the first reason and minimize the second reason that lawsuits can end at this stage.</p>
</div>
<div id="c0c66cf2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" level="A" class="epub-section epub-ahead cc-section"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-xlarge left"><h2><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0c66cf3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">A.&nbsp;MODERN DISCOVERY</p></h2></div>


<p id="c0c66cf4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One hundred years ago, litigants had a limited range of discovery devices that could be used only against some persons, and only in some kinds of actions. Discovery was not always a matter of right, and, as a result, litigants were often surprised by evidence produced at trial. This recipe could produce good courtroom drama, but not, critics argued, truth or justice.</p>
<p id="c0c66cf5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="456" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-456">p. 456</span>Modern discovery has changed that picture. Both state courts and the federal system have adopted broad civil discovery rules that permit a lawyer to uncover, in advance of trial, enormous amounts of information lying solely in the possession of her adversary. Parties can use multiple tools to unearth information. Parties can be required to disclose information damning to their case. And information must be disclosed even if it will not ultimately be used at trial. Courts can limit discovery in various ways that we will explore in this chapter. Even with these limits, however, the scope and depth of modern U.S. discovery practice make it unique among today’s legal systems.</p>
<p id="c0c66cf6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To appreciate both the opportunities and the challenges presented by modern discovery, recall the preceding chapter and the dispute between Michael Haddle and Jeanette Garrison (and her company, Healthmaster). Michael Haddle claimed he had been fired from his job at Healthmaster because he cooperated with an FBI investigation of the company and Mrs. Garrison, who was eventually convicted of Medicare fraud. One of his claims is brought pursuant to a Reconstruction-era statute that creates a cause of action against anyone who “injure[s]. . . . a person. . . . on account of his having. . . . testified” in a court proceeding. The plaintiff’s theory was that he was fired for cooperating with the FBI investigation, triggering liability under the federal statute.</p>

<p id="c0c66cf9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even before Haddle’s lawyer filed his complaint, Healthmaster and Garrison (and their lawyers) should have thought hard about what documents and other information related to Haddle’s work and termination they were required to preserve. Haddle and his attorney should also have given thought to what in Haddle’s possession they must preserve. To understand why, consider the next case. Although <i>Zubulake</i> concerns a discovery dispute that arose years into litigation, many of the lawyers’ and defendants’ missteps occurred before the lawsuit even began.</p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0c66d04-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">A. Background</p></div>
<p id="c0c66d05-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Zubulake filed an initial charge of gender discrimination with the EEOC on August 16, 2001. Well before that, however—as early as April 2001—UBS employees were on notice of Zubulake’s impending court action. After she received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, Zubulake filed this lawsuit on February 15, 2002.</p>
<p id="c0c66d06-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fully aware of their common law duty to preserve relevant evidence, UBs’s in-house attorneys gave oral instructions in August 2001—immediately after Zubulake filed her EEOC charge—instructing employees not to destroy or delete material potentially relevant to Zubulake’s claims, and in fact to segregate such material into separate files for the lawyers’ eventual review. . . . [These same instructions were reiterated in August 2001, and again in February, August, and September of 2002. Nevertheless, during discovery, the court found that UBS had deleted relevant e-mails from its active servers, destroyed some backup tapes, and failed to produce responsive e-mails in its possession.]  . . . </p>

<p id="c0c69418-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Spoliation is the destruction or significant alteration of evidence, or the failure to preserve property for another’s use as evidence in pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation. The determination of an appropriate sanction for spoliation, if any, is confined to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and is assessed on a case-by-case basis. The authority to sanction litigants for spoliation arises jointly under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the court’s inherent powers.</p>
<p id="c0c69419-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The spoliation of evidence germane to proof of an issue at trial can support an inference that the evidence would have been unfavorable to the party responsible for its destruction. A party seeking an adverse inference instruction (or other sanctions) based on the spoliation of evidence must establish the following three elements: (1) that the party having control over the evidence had an obligation to preserve it at the time it was destroyed; (2) that the records were destroyed with a “culpable state of mind” and (3) that the destroyed evidence was “relevant” to the party’s claim or defense such that a reasonable trier of fact could find that it would support that claim or defense.</p>
<p id="c0c6941a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . In <i>Zubulake IV,</i> I summarized a litigant’s preservation obligations:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0c6941b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once a party reasonably anticipates litigation, it must suspend its routine document retention/destruction policy and put in place a “litigation hold” to ensure the preservation of relevant documents. As a general rule, that litigation hold does not apply to inaccessible backup tapes (<i>e.g.,</i> those typically maintained solely for the purpose of disaster recovery), which may continue to be recycled on the schedule set forth in the company’s policy. On the other hand, if backup tapes are accessible (<i>i.e.,</i> actively used for information retrieval), then such tapes <i>would</i> likely be subject to the litigation hold.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0c6941c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="458" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-458">p. 458</span>A party’s discovery obligations do not end with the implementation of a “litigation hold"—to the contrary, that’s only the beginning. . . . </p>
<p id="c0c6941d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once a “litigation hold” is in place, a party and her counsel must make certain that all sources of potentially relevant information are identified and placed “on hold,” to the extent required in <i>Zubulake IV.</i> To do this, counsel must become fully familiar with her client’s document retention policies, as well as the client’s data retention architecture. This will invariably involve speaking with information technology personnel, who can explain system-wide backup procedures and the actual (as opposed to theoretical) implementation of the firm’s recycling policy. It will also involve communicating with the “key players” in the litigation, in order to understand how they stored information. In this case, for example, some UBS employees created separate computer files pertaining to Zubulake, while others printed out relevant e-mails and retained them in hard copy only. Unless counsel interviews each employee, it is impossible to determine whether all potential sources of information have been inspected. . . . </p>
<p id="c0c6941e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To the extent that it may not be feasible for counsel to speak with every key player, given the size of a company or the scope of the lawsuit, counsel must be more creative. . . . [I]t is <i>not</i> sufficient to notify all employees of a litigation hold and expect that the party will then retain and produce all relevant information. Counsel must take affirmative steps to monitor compliance so that all sources of discoverable information are identified and searched. This is not to say that counsel will necessarily succeed in locating all such sources, or that the later discovery of new sources is evidence of a lack of effort. But counsel and client must take <i>some reasonable steps</i> to see that sources of relevant information are located.</p>
<p id="c0c6941f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . The <i>continuing</i> duty to supplement disclosures strongly suggests that parties also have a duty to make sure that discoverable information is not lost. Indeed, the notion of a “duty to preserve” connotes an ongoing obligation. Obviously, if information is lost or destroyed, it has not been preserved. . . . </p>
<p id="c0c69420-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are thus a number of steps that counsel should take to ensure compliance with the preservation obligation. While these precautions may not be enough (or may be too much) in some cases, they are designed to promote the continued preservation of potentially relevant information in the typical case.</p>
<p id="c0c69421-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>First,</i> counsel must issue a “litigation hold” at the outset of litigation or whenever litigation is reasonably anticipated. The litigation hold should be periodically re-issued so that new employees are aware of it, and so that it is fresh in the minds of all employees.</p>
<p id="c0c69422-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Second,</i> counsel should communicate directly with the “key players” in the litigation, <i>i.e.,</i> the people identified in a party’s initial disclosure and any subsequent supplementation thereto. Because these “key players” are the “employees likely to have relevant information,” it is particularly important that the preservation duty be communicated clearly to them. As with the litigation hold, the key players should be periodically reminded that the preservation duty is still in place.</p>
<p id="c0c69423-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Finally,</i> counsel should instruct all employees to produce electronic copies of their relevant active files. Counsel must also make sure that all backup media which the party is required to retain is identified and stored in a safe place. . . . </p>
<p id="c0c69424-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">UBS’s in-house counsel issued a litigation hold in August 2001 and repeated that instruction several times from September 2001 through September 2002. Outside <span title="459" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-459">p. 459</span>counsel also spoke with some (but not all) of the key players in August 2001. Nonetheless, certain employees unquestionably deleted e-mails. Although many of the deleted e-mails were recovered from backup tapes, a number of backup tapes—and the e-mails on them—are lost forever. Other employees, notwithstanding counsel’s request that they produce their files on Zubulake, did not do so. . . . </p>
<p id="c0c69425-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Counsel failed to communicate the litigation hold order to all key players. They also failed to ascertain each of the key players’ document management habits. By the same token, UBS employees—for unknown reasons—ignored many of the instructions that counsel gave. This case represents a failure of communication, and that failure falls on counsel and client alike.</p>
<p id="c0c69426-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the end of the day, however, the duty to preserve and produce documents rests on the party. Once that duty is made clear to a party, either by court order or by instructions from counsel, that party is on notice of its obligations and acts at its own peril. Though more diligent action on the part of counsel would have mitigated some of the damage caused by UBS’s deletion of e-mails, UBS deleted the e-mails in defiance of explicit instructions not to.</p>

<p id="c0c6bb48-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Well within the memory of lawyers now in practice, discovery consisted of combing through paper files—sometimes entire warehouses of those files, but more often a much smaller number of documents. The digital revolution has changed that world forever. Even in run-of-the-mill litigation, digital records will usually exist and be critically important to the case. Take an everyday suit arising from an auto accident. Lawyers on both sides will want to capture the drivers’ cell-phone records—was either one texting or otherwise distracted? In addition, cars built since 2006 contain versions of the “black box” on airplanes, that capture the vehicle’s speed, braking, and perhaps more, depending on the year of manufacture. The lawyers will want to be sure that these recorders are preserved and their data analyzed. If any of the parties received medical attention, those records will likely be in digital form. If the quality of that medical care is in question (did it, for example, exacerbate injuries?), lawyers will want to make sure that those records are preserved and turned over in a form that allows the parties to see if the medical records have been edited in a way designed to cover up lapses in that care. With all this at play in a simple case, you can imagine the mountains of data facing the parties in a complex dispute—say a product liability claim (with vast digital data relating to the design, testing, and marketing of the product) or a complex commercial dispute with multiple drafts of many documents created over years of the now-broken relationship.</p>
<p id="c0c6bb49-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All lawyers today need to know a little about preservation and requests of digital information. Some large firms (and large government and nonprofit legal organizations) have formed sub-groups, usually consisting of some lawyers and some technically adept nonlawyers, which specialize in issues of digital information; firms will rely on those groups for anything beyond routine discovery matters. At the same time, an entire industry has sprung up alongside the bar, companies that offer what they call “litigation support services,” assisting lawyers in creating and responding to requests for digital information: For a fee, these companies will search large databases for key words and phrases, the most sophisticated using machine learning to suggest alternative words or phrases that might correspond to the request in question. Some law firms will sub-contract digital discovery to such companies.</p>
<p id="c0c6bb4a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="461" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-461">p. 461</span>One issue that regularly arises in both large and small digital discovery is that of “meta-data.” Roughly speaking, meta-data consists of information embedded in a digital file that describes the history of the document in question—including revisions to the document. Think, for example, of a contract that undergoes several drafts, with changes made in response to various comments by those within the drafting organization: The other side would dearly love to know why various changes were made. Sometimes such comments and changes will be protected by lawyer-client privilege or work product (to be discussed a bit later), but not always. Even if they are not protected, the requesting party won’t get the comments and ensuing revisions unless it requests records that reflect the meta-data; experienced parties devote part of their pretrial conference to hashing out issues relating to meta-data so they don’t end up with mutual recriminations before an annoyed judge. A related problem concerns data that are comprehensible only when read by certain software. Although most parties will be able to open Word documents or PowerPoints, it is not uncommon in many industries to have data files that can only be read by software that is not readily available and not inexpensive. Rule 34 tries to address this problem by permitting parties to request discovery of information that requires “translation by the responding party into reasonably usable form.” Note that, as with meta-data, a well-counselled party will ask for such translation as part of an initial request.</p>

<p id="c0c6bb4d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before beginning discovery, parties must not only preserve evidence in their possession—they must also think carefully about what evidence they will be looking for. In other words, lawyers need an overall discovery strategy. Experienced lawyers tell us that they ask themselves several questions: What information do I need to assemble to prove my claim or defense? What part of that information do I already have? What information might lie in the hands of my adversary (or other parties) and how can I most efficiently acquire that information? And, often just as important, what information now in my possession would I just as soon the other party not know about, and is there a way I can lawfully shield that information? (Often the answer to the last question will be no, but it is worth thinking about.)</p>
<p id="c0c6bb4e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To answer these questions, and thus to frame a discovery plan, the lawyer needs to envision two stories—the story she wants to tell concerning her claim or defense, and the story she expects to hear from her adversary. If the lawyer does not have such stories in mind, it is quite likely that she will blunder in two ways. First, she will ask for “everything,” a request that will likely be met with resistance and perhaps a motion for sanctions. Second, our hypothetical lawyer with this blunderbuss approach is quite likely to fail to ask the crucial two or three questions necessary for her to tell her story effectively—because she is looking in all directions at once. So—think and sketch story lines before you ask for information.</p>
<p id="c0c6bb4f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two qualifications to this advice are necessary. In some cases there will be several alternative stories, each of which is plausible, but none of which our lawyer pos<span title="462" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-462">p. 462</span>sesses enough information to tell convincingly. Remember the preceding chapter with its explanation of alternative pleading (see supra page 408)? You now are in a better position to understand why a lawyer acting in entirely good faith might, at an early stage, want to plead alternative stories—and then pursue discovery that would determine which story she wants to (or plausibly can) settle on.</p>
<p id="c0c6bb50-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second, related qualification is that discovery will sometimes turn up entirely unexpected information that may cause a lawyer to shift stories significantly, not just choosing among already pleaded alternatives but striking out in a new direction. A frequently stated ground for amending a pleading—and a ground on which judges will almost always grant leave to amend—is that discovery produced new information enabling the lawyer to tell a better—that is, more convincing—but different story.</p>
<p id="c0c6bb51-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In spite of these two qualifications, the basic point stands: Think and sketch stories before planning discovery. A lawyer who does this can conduct more efficient, more focused, and likely more effective discovery. A lawyer who fails to do this is likely to find himself wandering into many blind passages and may well overlook critical information because he doesn’t realize he needs it, as well as a motion by the other side to curtail discovery as disproportionate.</p>
<p id="c0c6bb52-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Think again about <i>Haddle v. Garrison</i>. You’ll recall that Garrison’s first preference was not to have to tell any story at all—hence the 12(b)(6) motion—a strategy the Supreme Court ultimately rejected. Now that they are back in the district court, imagine what story Haddle would want to tell and what story Garrison would want to tell. What information would each need in order to tell those stories?</p>

<p id="c0c6e265-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now that you know what you’re looking for—a story (in fact, at least two stories, yours and theirs)—consider how you might gather the material to tell those stories. Most of attorneys’ time in most civil cases is spent not in researching arcane bits of law, but in unearthing the facts of the case. Factual investigation not involving the discovery rules is entirely possible and can sometimes be more important than formal discovery. Telephone calls, informal interviews, examination of public records, online searches, and the like will often yield enormous amounts of information. It is important for the beginning lawyer not to become so mesmerized by the tool kit of formal discovery as to forget the existence of other means of gathering information.</p>
<p id="c0c6e266-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But in the great majority of cases lawyers also need to understand the workings of the discovery tools at their disposal. The easiest way to understand how these tools function is first to read Rules 16 and 26-37; then, refer again to specific Rules as this survey touches on them. As you read, consider why the discovery rules contain more detail than, say, the pleading rules.</p>
<p id="c0c6e267-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="463" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-463">p. 463</span><i>Rule 26</i> is the master rule. It catalogues the types of information subject to discovery and imposes discovery-related requirements on the parties throughout the litigation. (Those details can be found largely in Rule 26(b) and (c), about which we will learn more soon.) Rule 26(f) instructs the parties to confer with each other at the outset of a case about predicted subjects of discovery, anticipated disputes about the discoverability of desired information, and other issues that the judge might be able to resolve at an early stage.</p>
<p id="c0c6e268-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Within two weeks of this planning meeting—and before an initial conference with the judge—the parties must exchange the “initial disclosures” required by Rule 26(a)(1). Once the judge has the initial conference with the parties, and issues a scheduling order (required by Rule 16(b)), further discovery can follow. Typically, that discovery will consist of requests for documents, interrogatories, requests for admission, and depositions, followed by reports of expert witnesses if they are to be used, and, if the case proceeds to trial, another round of disclosures mandated by Rule 26—this time the list of witnesses and other evidence each party will present at trial. Rule 26(a)(3). Finally, Rule 16, whose scheduling conference began the sequence, also closes discovery after a final pretrial conference and order for cases destined for trial. Rule 16(e). Graphically displayed, the sequence looks like this:</p>

<p id="c0c6e270-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26(a) describes the first stage, which it calls “required disclosures.” These can be extensive and themselves come in stages, the first of which the Rules call the “Initial Disclosure.” Rule 26(a)(1) requires the parties to exchange categories of information “that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses.” That information includes the names and locations of witnesses and descriptions and location of documents, as well as calculations of damages and copies of insurance agreements. Each party must offer such information without its having been requested by her opponent and before the initial conference with the judge. Rule 26(a)(1)(C).

The company lawyer has interviewed Garrison (the Chair of the Board and President of Healthmaster during the period in question) and learned that she had been “minimally satisfied” with Haddle’s work. Garrison brings some documents to the meeting, including a series of generally positive performance reviews, which Garrison characterizes as “boilerplate—everyone gets a positive review unless they’re stealing money,” and e-mails from Garrison to Human Resources sent two months before Haddle was fired, expressing concern that Haddle was overpaid and exploring the going rate for persons with Haddle’s job at comparable firms.

<p id="c0c730a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the Rule 26(f) meeting between the parties and the mandatory disclosures are out of the way, the parties’ lawyers can embark on the next phases of discovery. <span title="467" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-467">p. 467</span>Although attorneys will use different discovery tools in different sequences, they will often begin with requests for production. In many cases the lawyers will know at the outset of the suit (perhaps from the initial disclosures) that there are documents or physical objects they want to get their hands on: e-mails, hospital bills, vehicle maintenance records, the wrecked car itself, and so on.</p>
<p id="c0c730a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 34 enables such discovery. It has a broad scope, encompassing not only documents but any tangible item, land, or electronically stored information. An e-mail message stored on a computer’s hard drive, or on a backup tape made for crash-recovery purposes, is discoverable, as is a photograph or videotape or stored voicemail or text message or Instagram post. So is a software program with embedded accounting data or other information. As we described, supra page 460, the growth of digital data storage has substantially expanded the amount of information subject to discovery in lawsuits, spawned an entire sub-industry devoted to searching electronic records, and complicated attorneys’ document requests to include meta-data and translations of material into usable forms.</p>
<p id="c0c730a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How exactly must the requester identify the documents in question? In practice, very broad requests are usually allowed because the party propounding the request does not always know what documents the responding party has. A typical request might seek all documents in the custody or control of the responding party that “refer, relate or pertain in any manner” to subject <i>X</i>. Such broad requests might end up calling for hundreds, thousands, or even millions of documents, only a small portion of which bear even the remotest potential relevance to the lawsuit. The responding party, faced with such a request, has several choices. It might object to the request as overbroad or not “proportional” to the needs of the case pursuant to Rule 26(b)(1), a rule to which we will soon turn. The party might, in the alternative, assign its employees the time-consuming task of searching all files and digital locations where responsive information might be found. Or the party might point to a warehouse or digital storage of two million files, leaving the requesting party with the daunting challenge of separating wheat from chaff. Read Rule 34(b)(2)(E)(i) and think about how this Rule might justify this third approach.</p>
<p id="c0c730a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus far, we have focused on requests for production served on parties to the case. Similar requests can be made of a nonparty, but the nonparty must be served with a subpoena issued under Rule 45(a)(1)(A)(iii).</p>
<p id="c0c730a7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the many complications of Rules 34 and 45, it is critical for lawyers to understand and become adept at using these Rules. In a contract dispute over the interpretation of an ambiguous provision of a contract, for example, each side will want to see any drafts, memos, or notes that might reflect the other side’s contemporaneous interpretation of the disputed provision, and will want later to use these documents in deposing the other side’s witnesses. These types of documents will often be critical in establishing or disproving liability. Documents can also be critical in establishing damages. Medical records, for example, are central to damage discovery in personal injury cases, and accounting records would be the core of discovery in a case seeking lost profits.</p>

Haddle’s lawyer makes a Rule 34 request for “all documents, memoranda, and reports relating to the dismissal of Haddle or other employees over the two years preceding Haddle’s dismissal until the dissolution of the company.” Healthmaster’s lawyer learns that on the day of Haddle’s firing, Garrison (recall she was Healthmaster’s CEO) wrote an e-mail to another employee stating “this should cut down on the number of skunks running to the feds.” Must the attorney for Healthmaster produce this e-mail? Which Rule would guide her decision?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0c730ab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose that Haddle’s request for “all documents, memoranda, and reports relating to the dismissal of Haddle or other employees over the two years preceding Haddle’s dismissal until the dissolution of the company” does not specify the format for responses. Healthmaster’s lawyer has found hundreds of responsive e-mails and other documents. Can Healthmaster simply produce printouts of these e-mails and documents—which will be hard to search and will not contain evidence of revisions? See Rule 34(b)(2)(E).</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0c757bd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Modern criminal procedure requires that prosecutors turn over to defense counsel information that might tend to exonerate a defendant. Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). Haddle’s lawyer believes that as Garrison’s prosecution went forward Garrison received from prosecutors information about people who were cooperating with the FBI, that Garrison identified Haddle as a cooperator with this information, and that she fired Haddle based on this information. Haddle requests this information from Garrison, but also wants to request it directly from the FBI. Could Haddle request from the FBI a complete set of the information it turned over to Garrison? How? Rule 45.</p></li>

<p id="c0c757c0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While requests for production seek production of documents and things, interrogatories (Rule 33) seek out categories of information that can guide further document requests and depositions. For example, in the suit between Haddle and Healthmaster, interrogatories can be used to learn the names and addresses of all those involved in the decision to fire Haddle, every type of employment review <span title="469" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-469">p. 469</span>and evaluation conducted by the company, and information about all of the people interviewed for Haddle’s job after he was fired.</p>
<p id="c0c757c1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Interrogatories have some benefits: They can get at information not contained in any document, and they are typically much cheaper than conducting a deposition because one can inexpensively frame a set of appropriate questions, send the requests to an adverse party, and sit back and wait for the answers. A drawback to interrogatories is that, because the questioner cannot follow up evasive answers with a question designed to pin things down, interrogatories that go beyond fairly routine requests for specific information may yield little of value. Another limitation of interrogatories is that parties are presumptively limited to 25 questions (including subparts) to each of their adversaries. Parties must seek permission of the court—or a stipulation from their opponents—before propounding more. A third limitation is that interrogatories may be sent only to a party; nonparty witnesses may be deposed but need not answer written interrogatories. (In contrast, parties can make unlimited requests for production of documents and things, and can make these requests to nonparties through a subpoena.)</p>
<p id="c0c757c2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Requests for Admissions (Rule 36) share three characteristics with interrogatories. They are usable only against parties, are in writing, and are relatively cheap. One significant difference between the two is that parties can make an unlimited number of requests for admission. This makes sense if one views Rule 36 as much a pleading rule as a discovery device. While interrogatories uncover categories of evidence, requests for admission seek to take issues out of controversy. Suppose Haddle pleads that Healthmaster is a corporation but does so in a paragraph of the complaint that contains other allegations as well, making defendant’s denial of the entire paragraph ambiguous. (Cf. <i>Zielinski v. Philadelphia Piers</i>, supra page 428.) Plaintiff might well seek an admission as to defendant’s corporate status. Because of Rule 37(c)(2), Rule 36 has teeth.</p>
<p id="c0c757c3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 36 functions best when used to eliminate essentially undisputed issues—for example, that the defendant is incorporated in Georgia or that Haddle received notice of his termination on a particular day. Requests for admission that go to the core of the case will likely be less successful. In this case, such a request might be: “Admit that you fired Michael Haddle as a result of his cooperation with the federal investigation.” Rule 36 instructs parties to admit, deny, or explain in detail why they can neither admit nor deny. Healthmaster can deny this request for admission, but if Haddle later proves the statement to be true, he can move for Healthmaster to pay reasonable expenses incurred in making the proof. Rule 37(c)(2). As with answers to pleadings, parties can also admit in part or deny in part. Responding in good faith to requests to admit without showing too much of one’s hand is an exercise in subtlety and discretion.</p>
<p id="c0c757c4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Complications can arise when the party served with a request for admission of critical facts has simply let the time for reply elapse without responding. Read literally, the Rule suggests that the requested facts should be deemed admitted, and courts have so held. Rule 36(a)(3). But courts have also ignored the literal language or have glossed over it when the request for admission concerns a purely legal issue or is ambiguous. Talley v. United States, 990 F.2d 695 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>

Healthmaster intends to argue that all the firings resulted from the financial stress produced by the criminal case against Jeanette Garrison. Hugh Scott, one of those employees, in a routine “exit interview” conducted by the Human Resources department, tells the interviewer that his immediate supervisor, as he handed him the termination letter, muttered something like, “A pity we have to sacrifice you to get rid of that skunk Haddle.” Scott also told Human Resources he had heard rumors that supervisors made similar remarks to other employees terminated at the same time.</p>

<p id="c0c77de1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By this point, the parties will likely have accumulated a good deal of information through document requests, interrogatories, and requests for admission. As each of these pieces of information arrives, the lawyers will be trying to join them together with existing information to support their version of the case. Now comes the moment to try to pin down parties’ and witnesses’ stories before trial. That moment comes in depositions. Rules 27-32 concern issues related to depositions, but it is Rule 30 that sets out the most significant aspects of deposition rules and procedures.</p>
<p id="c0c77de2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In one respect, a deposition is like questioning a witness at trial without the judge—except that the location will usually be a conference room rather than a courthouse. A lawyer for each party is present, as are the witness and a court reporter or recording device. The lawyer who “noticed” (lawyer-talk for requested) the deposition will ask questions that the witness must answer orally under oath. The witness’s lawyer may object to the content or form of the questions and may ask questions of his own when the other lawyer finishes. The court reporter makes a verbatim transcript of the deposition, and the testimony is often visually recorded as well.</p>
<p id="c0c77de3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In other respects, depositions are quite unlike trials. At trial, a good lawyer will be trying to use questions and other evidence to tell a single, coherent, clear story leading to a favorable verdict or judgment for her client. Accordingly, the lawyer at trial will avoid asking any question that might be distracting or might harm her case. By contrast, at depositions lawyers have opportunities to explore what may turn out to be dead ends, and to ask questions without having the least notion of what the answer might be. A version of the same contrast applies to the treatment of hostile witnesses: At trial, a lawyer will seek to undermine their credibility and expose weaknesses in their testimony. In deposition, the goal is different. Although a lawyer will be delighted if the opposing party admits that his claims or defenses are a pack of lies, she is not expecting or aiming at that goal. Instead, she is meticulously trying to pin down an adverse witness to whatever story that witness wants to tell; once the story is pinned down under oath, the lawyer can decide what to do with it. Finally, depositions free lawyers from some constraints of evidentiary rules. At trial, if a lawyer asks a question whose answer is subject to an evidentiary objection and the other side’s lawyer objects, the trial judge will direct the witness not to answer the question. In a deposition, the witness must answer the question (unless the answer would reveal privileged information or information protected by court order). The objection is noted on the record, and the court may prevent this portion of the deposition from being used at later stages of litigation, but the answer is recorded. As a result, some depositions yield a good deal of information that will not be admissible.</p>
<p id="c0c77de4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The major advantage of a deposition over interrogatories is that the lawyer can ask a series of questions that forces the witness to take a position as to the <span title="472" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-472">p. 472</span>matters at issue, and the lawyer can immediately follow up with further questions if the witness is evasive or if the testimony opens up new avenues of inquiry. The disadvantage is expense to all concerned. In a deposition, both sides have their lawyers present; if the witness is not one of the parties, he or she may also be represented by a lawyer. In addition, the lawyer who noticed the deposition must arrange for a court reporter to transcribe the deposition and, sometimes, a videographer. In a case with multiple parties, each hour of deposition time may amount to thousands of dollars in attorneys’ fees and stenographer’s and videographer’s time.</p>
<p id="c0c77de5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As with interrogatories, the Rules place limits on depositions. Without seeking permission, the total number of depositions taken by one side (plaintiff(s), defendant(s), third-party defendant(s)) may not exceed ten; no deposition may exceed a day of seven hours; and no person may be deposed a second time without the permission of the court or the other side. See Rule 30(a)(2)(A)(i).</p>
<p id="c0c77de6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Conducting depositions of witnesses embedded in large organizations (corporations, governments, universities, etc.) presents special problems. Sometimes the lawyer will want to depose a person with knowledge about a particular area—product design, marketing, curriculum, etc.—without knowing who in the organization has that information. Rule 30(b)(6) allows the requester to identify a topic to be explored, placing the burden on the organization to produce a knowledgeable person.</p>
<p id="c0c77de7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Parties can undergo an additional, particularly sensitive type of questioning and investigation, this time by doctors instead of lawyers. Rule 35 allows physical and mental examinations of parties and usually is employed only when the physical or mental condition of the party is at stake in the case. Take, for example, <i>Reise</i>, in Chapter 1, in which the court orders a psychological evaluation of a plaintiff who alleged emotional injuries resulting from defendants’ actions. Similarly, a plaintiff who alleges physical injury might be evaluated by a doctor chosen by the defendant. Unlike other discovery provisions, Rule 35 requires a special application to the court and a showing of “good cause” for such an evaluation. The disputes here focus on what constitutes “good cause,” with courts asked to balance need against issues of privacy.</p>
<p id="c0c7a4f8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is well settled that a plaintiff who puts his mental or physical condition at issue by seeking damages for mental or physical injury can be required to undergo a mental or physical examination. The same is true where a defendant has specifically asserted a defense that puts his mental or physical condition at issue. If the defendant in a contract case files an answer that pleads as an affirmative defense that the defendant was mentally incompetent and therefore could not enter into a binding contract, the defendant could be required to undergo an examination regarding his mental capacity.</p>
<p id="c0c7a4f9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the law is much less permissive about allowing physical or mental exams where a party has not clearly put her own physical or mental condition at issue. In the leading case, Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U.S. 104 (1964), a Greyhound bus rear-ended a tractor-trailer. Passengers on the bus were injured and brought suit <span title="473" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-473">p. 473</span>against Greyhound, the driver, the owner of the tractor, and the owner of the trailer. The tractor and trailer owners sought—and the district judge ordered—vision, neurological, psychiatric, and internal medicine exams of the defendant bus driver. In support of the exams, the tractor owner’s counsel submitted an affidavit which stated that the driver had testified at his deposition that he had seen the rear lights of the vehicle ahead of him for 10-15 seconds, but had not slowed down, and had rear-ended the vehicle. The affidavit also established that the bus driver had been involved in a prior similar accident.</p>
<p id="c0c7a4fa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A divided Supreme Court held that the record supported at most a vision exam of the driver. The majority concluded that “[n]othing in the pleadings or affidavit would afford a basis for a belief that Schlagenhauf was suffering from a mental or neurological illness warranting wide-ranging psychiatric or neurological examinations. Nor is there anything stated justifying the broad internal medicine examination.” The dissenters would have allowed all of the exams ordered by the district court. The dissenting opinion reasoned: “In a collision case like this one, evidence concerning very bad eyesight or impaired mental or physical health which may affect the ability to drive is obviously of the highest relevance. It is equally obvious, I think, that when a vehicle continues down an open road and smashes into a truck in front of it although the truck is in plain sight and there is ample time and room to avoid collision, the chances are good that the driver has some physical, mental or moral defect. When such a thing happens twice, one is even more likely to ask, ’What is the matter with that driver? Is he blind or crazy?’”</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0c7f33a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Discussing each of the procedural tools one by one—required disclosures, requests for documents, interrogatories, requests for admission, and depositions—fails to capture the ways in which different types of requests can relate one to the other and inspire further inquiry. Imagine, for example, that Haddle’s lawyer conducts her Rule 30(b)(6) deposition of Geraldine Chen, the vice president for Human Resources. Haddle’s lawyer learns during Chen’s deposition that, a few years before Haddle’s dismissal, Healthmaster fired another employee when the firm was under another investigation. Haddle’s attorney will most likely submit a document request seeking records concerning that previous firing. Upon reviewing those records, Haddle’s attorney might learn that Healthmaster has a previously undisclosed “special employee review” process for employees who cooperated in this prior investigation, and demand production of records reflecting that process. Haddle’s attorney might also submit an interrogatory seeking a list of all previous employees dismissed after that special process was invoked. In other words, parties will usually make comprehensive document requests before taking depositions but depositions can prompt additional document requests and interrogatories; those documents and interrogatory responses can prompt additional depositions and requests. The next chart attempts to illustrate the fluidity with which these discovery tools may be used.</p></li>

<p id="c0c8416d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The discovery process ends in the way it begins—with a final round of disclosures. These disclosures include a list of the witnesses and other evidence—expert reports, exhibits, documents—that each side proposes to introduce at trial. Rule 26(a)(3). (See <i>Monfore v. Phillips,</i> infra page 619, for an illustration of the constraints a final pretrial order can place on trial.) In many cases, these final pretrial disclosures will be set in concrete by the judge’s final pretrial conference and the ensuing order. Rule 16(e). Contrary to the impression one might gain from depictions of trials in film and other media, the final pretrial order practically forecloses the possibility of surprise witnesses and evidence.</p>

<p id="c0c84170-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the parties bear the costs of fact investigation in the U.S. legal system, imbalances in each side’s financial resources could affect the outcome of cases regardless of the merits. Note that the problem isn’t merely or even primarily “which litigant has the most money.” A poor litigant with a strong claim for substantial damages will have plenty of litigation resources if she finds a well-financed lawyer to take her case on a contingent fee basis. As is described in Chapter 5, parties with strong claims can also borrow to finance litigation, including discovery. As a result, a wealthy defendant whose defense is being financed by a liability insurer seeking to reduce litigation expenses may have fewer resources than a poorer plaintiff with strong financial backing. And a defendant who perceives that more is at stake than the individual case suggests—reputation, subsequent similar claims—may be willing to spend more than the case warrants. Although the motivations and resources available to parties vary from case to case, there are undoubtedly many situations in which David is battling Goliath.</p>
<p id="c0c84171-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What impact does mismatched resources have on discovery? The problem has two versions. First, what happens if one party lacks resources to do adequate discovery? The most troubling case arises when most of the likely evidence is in defendant’s hands, and the assembly of evidence would likely be complex—perhaps in a product liability or environmental hazard claim. Without access to discovery, such a claim has no chance of succeeding. Although the Rules nowhere address this problem specifically, several possibilities present themselves. The party with fewer resources may be able to collect evidence from various public sources—government or public documents, press sources, and the like. Digital media and the Internet have made such searches much faster and cheaper than they were 50 years ago. Moreover, a disciplined discovery scheme making maximum use of cheap discovery (such as document requests and interrogatories) may yield a good deal. With large public and private institutions, well-planned document requests can produce rich veins of information. With the information developed from such <span title="478" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-478">p. 478</span>cheap discovery, a party might be able to approach one of the growing number of firms that advance litigation costs on the basis of their assessment of the merits of an individual case (see supra pages 344-45). It is also worth remembering that in most large institutions there is (a) often another copy of the missing document and (b) someone in whose interest it is to disclose that document or say who destroyed it—if only to avoid blame falling on him.</p>
<p id="c0c84172-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may also be possible to freeride on the discovery efforts of others: A deposition conducted by one party will likely yield useful information for a coparty or a future litigation. One Rule makes this avenue more difficult to pursue. Rule 5(d)(1) forbids parties from filing with the court many discovery responses “until they are used in the proceeding or the court orders filing.” The motivation behind this amendment was simple: Courts were running out of space to store such documents. But the consequences may be to curtail the availability of discovery materials in separate but factually related cases, making it harder for an ill-funded party to “piggyback” on another’s efforts unless the attorneys in the cases coordinate. On the other hand, a party seeking these litigation materials can simply subpoena them from the parties in the other case (assuming they are not covered by a protective order of the kind at issue in <i>Kalinauskas v. Wong,</i> at page 546).</p>
<p id="c0c84173-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second problem comes if we assume grossly mismatched resources: A modestly financed plaintiff faces an institutional defendant who anticipates many similar cases to come is motivated to spend what appears to be an irrational amount on the particular case. Again, this may be more a problem of litigation finance than of the discovery rules, but a few comments may put the issue in context. If plaintiff’s lawyer perceives this to be the case, one possibility is to partner with other lawyers who may be interested in financing this case because they relish the possibility of the future cases the defendant is seeking to avert. Another possibility would be to try to use defendant’s fears as leverage for a settlement: An unlitigated case will not yield discovery that can be used in future cases. Parties can also use the Rules to address some of these resource issues. Rule 26(b)(1), amended in 2015, now provides that the scope of discovery be “proportional to the needs of the case,” determined, in part, by the parties’ resources. And a party might seek to use the provision of Rule 26(g) that requires each lawyer to certify that discovery requests or objections are “neither unreasonable nor unduly burdensome or expensive, considering the needs of the case, prior discovery in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the action.”</p>

<p id="c0c86886-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having now surveyed the types of discovery tools that each side can use to uncover information, we now turn to the breadth of information that can be uncovered with these tools. Both the power and the destructive potential of the discovery tools hinge on the scope of their reach.</p>
<p id="c0c86887-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26(b)(1) allows the parties, without court approval, to seek discovery “regarding any nonprivileged matter that is <i>relevant</i> to any party’s claim or defense.” Discoverability does not, however, turn on relevance alone. Even relevant information <span title="479" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-479">p. 479</span>can be protected from discovery if it is <i>privileged</i> (Rule 26(b)(1)); if it is unduly cumulative, duplicative, burdensome, or not proportional to the needs of the case (Rules 26(b)(1) and 26(b)(2)(C)); or if its potential for annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense outweigh its evidentiary value (Rule 26(b)(2)(C)). We will consider the scope of each of these terms.</p>
<div id="c0c86888-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0c86889-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">1.&nbsp;Relevance</p></h3></div>

<p id="c0c8688a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be admissible at trial, evidence must be relevant. “Relevance” links admissibility to the substantive law and to common-sense patterns of inference. Start with common sense: How I tie my shoelaces is irrelevant to whether it will rain today; how the sky looks is highly relevant to that question. But legal relevance demands more than this. For a piece of information to be relevant to a legal proposition, that information must tend to prove or disprove something the governing substantive law says matters. If it doesn’t matter, the law of evidence will prevent that information from being presented at trial. For example, if, in a contract dispute, the defendant contends that he failed to pay for goods because the goods were defective, the condition of the goods will be relevant and can be offered in evidence. If the defendant instead contends that he failed to pay for the goods because he used the money to support a sick relative, the state of the relative’s health would be legally irrelevant. Its irrelevance flows from the law of contract, which says that one’s motives for breaching a contract don’t matter.</p>
<p id="c0c8688b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the discovery rules aim to unearth information that would be admissible at trial, they too are linked to relevance. But for discovery the links can be more attenuated. The Advisory Committee notes to Rule 26(b) explain that “[i]nformation within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.” For a simple example of information that would be relevant and discoverable—because likely to lead to admissible evidence—but not directly admissible, consider a deposition in an auto accident case. Plaintiff seeks evidence that the light was red when defendant entered the intersection. Witness has already said he did not observe the color of the light. Lawyer asks, “Did you hear anyone say that he or she saw that the light was red?” At trial, a judge would, if defendant objected, tell the lawyer not to ask that question because it calls for hearsay. But in discovery the question is proper because Witness’s response may well lead to identification of another witness who can say from personal observation whether the light was red.</p>
<p id="c0c8688c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both substantive law and pleading narrow the range of potentially relevant and thus discoverable information. In a claim for breach of contract to deliver goods, suppose the defendant pleaded, as his sole defense, the running of the statute of limitations. On the basis of that pleading, information about whether the plaintiff had fulfilled her part of the agreement would not be “relevant to” the defendant’s “defense.” By contrast, if in addition to pleading the running of the statute of limitations, defendant admitted that he failed to deliver the goods but asserted that he did so because plaintiff had not paid him for those goods, questions about plaintiff’s performance would become relevant and subject to discovery.</p>

<p id="c0c88fa5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff Maryann Favale worked as an administrative assistant at Saint Joseph’s School in Brookfield, Connecticut, for approximately twenty-one years. During this time period, in November of 2002, Sister Bernice Stobierski became the new interim principal. Then, in May 2003, Sister Stobierski assumed the position of full-time principal. Maryann Favale alleges that Sister Stobierski subjected her to “severe and repeated sexual harassment” in the workplace from December 2002 to June 2003. Specifically, plaintiff alleges that Sister Stobierski touched her inappropriately, made sexually suggestive comments, exhibited lewd behavior, and requested physical affection. Plaintiff first informed her employer, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport, (“the Diocese”) of the alleged sexual harassment on June 11, 2003. Maryann Favale, who no longer works at Saint Joseph’s School, seeks damages against the Diocese for sexual harassment, retaliation, defamation, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, negligent hiring, negligent supervision, and other causes of action. In addition, co-plaintiff Mark Favale asserts a claim for loss of consortium against the defendant. Sister Stobierski is not a party to this case.</p>
<p id="c0c88fa6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs now seek to compel Sister Stobierski to testify to any prior treatment she may have received for her alleged anger management history and psychological or psychiatric conditions. Plaintiffs also move to compel the Diocese to produce any records it has of any such treatment. [The Diocese objects to both motions to compel on relevance grounds, among others.]  . . . </p>

To assert a negligent hiring claim under Connecticut law, a plaintiff must “[p]lead and prove that she was injured by the defendant’s own negligence in failing to select as its employee a person who was fit and competent to perform the job in question and that her injuries resulted from the employee’s unfit or incompetent performance of his work.” Roberts v. Circuit-Wise, Inc., 142 F. Supp. 2d 211, 214 n.1 (D. Conn. 2001). Similarly, Connecticut law requires that a plaintiff bringing a negligent supervision claim</p>

Both negligent hiring and negligent supervision claims turn upon the type of wrongful conduct that actually precipitated the harm suffered by plaintiff. “It is well settled that defendants cannot be held liable for their alleged negligent hiring, training, supervision or retention of an employee accused of wrongful conduct unless they had notice of said employee’s propensity for the type of behavior causing the plaintiff’s harm.” Elbert v. Connecticut Yankee Council, Inc., No. CV010456879S, 2004 WL 1832935, at *13 (Conn. Super. Ct. July 16, 2004) (citations, internal quotation marks, and punctuation omitted).</p>
<p id="c0c88fab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs allege that the defendant negligently hired and supervised an individual who was not fit to be the principal of an elementary school. They contend that the “defendant knew or reasonably should have known that Sister Stobierski was unfit to be the principal of St. Joseph’s School as a result of her prior emotional and anger management issues, and limited school administration experience.”. . . . Yet, plaintiffs do not allege that Sister Stobierski’s prior emotional and anger management issues harmed plaintiff.</p>
<p id="c0c88fac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rather, the only type of harm alleged to have been suffered by Maryann Favale was harm resulting from repeated acts of sexual harassment, and plaintiffs do not maintain that Sister Stobierski’s alleged anger management and psychological or psychiatric conditions contributed to the sexual harassment. Accordingly, Sister Stobierski’s testimony pertaining to the treatment she allegedly received for her anger management, psychological, or psychiatric conditions is not relevant because it does not pertain to the defense or claim of any party.</p>
<p id="c0c88fad-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, even if the Diocese was aware of Sister Stobierski’s alleged anger management history or psychological or psychiatric conditions, this knowledge would have no bearing on plaintiffs’ claims for negligent supervision and negligent hiring because the wrongful conduct of which the Diocese would have had notice was not the same type of wrongful conduct that caused Maryann Favale harm. Notice of Sister Stobierski’s alleged anger management history or psychological or psychiatric conditions does not equate to notice of Sister Stobierski’s propensity to commit acts of sexual harassment. The Diocese’s objection to plaintiffs’ motion to compel the testimony of Sister Stobierski is sustained, and plaintiffs’ motion is denied.</p>

If Favale disagrees with the district court’s ruling, can she seek review in the court of appeals? The answer is yes, but not until there is a final judgment in the case. (See <i>Reise</i> in Chapter 1.) Realistically, Favale will not appeal the decision unless she loses her case against the Diocese on summary judgment or at trial. If she wins the case, this discovery dispute will no longer matter to her. If the case settles, a condition of settlement would most certainly be to foreclose further litigation of this matter.</p></li>

<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0c8b6cb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Albert and Barbara are involved in an automobile collision. Albert sues Barbara, alleging negligence. Barbara denies liability. Albert seeks to discover the size of Barbara’s bank account. (He wants to know whether she will be capable of satisfying a damage judgment.) Is this information discoverable? Probably not; the information, while relevant to Albert’s ability to recover a damage judgment, is not relevant to whether Barbara was negligent.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0c8b6cc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Same facts as in 4a, except that in addition to asserting negligence, Albert alleges that Barbara intentionally collided with him. Intentional torts carry with them the possibility of punitive damages, and in many jurisdictions a jury asked to award punitive damages may consider the wealth of the defendant, the idea being that the punishment should be tailored to the defendant’s circumstances. Albert again seeks to discover the size of Barbara’s bank account. It is now “relevant to a claim or defense” and thus discoverable because the amount of Barbara’s assets will determine an appropriate sanction. What has changed here is not the rules of discovery but the substantive law.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0c8dddd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Same lawsuit as in 4a—that is, a negligence action, with no allegations of intentional harm. Albert, fearing that Barbara may lack assets to pay damages, seeks to discover whether Barbara has a liability insurance policy that would be available to satisfy a damage judgment if he wins the suit. If one considers only relevance to a claim or defense, the insurance policy would seem irrelevant for the reasons described in the discussion of Problem 4a. Yet Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(iv) requires Barbara to disclose this information. This disclosure requirement, outside the bounds of relevance, appears to reflect a policy choice to discourage litigation pursued in the hope of non-existent assets.</p></li>

But the truth sometimes hurts, and a party being asked to disclose information can seek protection from the court if he believes that the burdens of producing the information outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p id="c0c8dde1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26(b)(1) provides that discovery requested must not only be relevant but also “proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties’ relative access to relevant information, the parties’ resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit.” When parties seek electronically stored information, Rule 26 requires not only that the information sought is proportional, but that it is reasonably accessible. Rule 26(b)(2)(B) provides that “[a] party need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the party identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost.”</p>

<p id="c0c904fd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . Request Number 4 seeks “[a]ll accident reports and records relating to any injury allegedly caused by the product.” Request Number 5 seeks “[a]ll consumer complaints of any type relating to the product.” Plaintiff defined the term “product” as the “MagicBullet/Nutribullet Pro 900 series that is the subject of this litigation.” In response, Defendant objected to both requests as vague, ambiguous, overbroad, not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, [and] not proportional to the needs of the case. . . . </p>
<p id="c0c904fe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he Court agrees that Plaintiff’s requests are overbroad and not proportional to the needs of the case. The requests contain no time limitation and no limitation as to the type of injury at issue, the subject matter of the complaints requested, the alleged defect at issue, or the circumstances of the incident in the materials requested. Defendant asserts that if Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel is granted, Plaintiff should only be entitled to discovery of incidents “similar enough” to the incident Plaintiff describes in her deposition. Specifically, Defendant states the requests should be limited to similar incidents where “the Nutribullet Pro 900 cup could not be untwisted from the base to turn it off.” Defendant further asserts that Plaintiff should not be entitled <span title="485" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-485">p. 485</span>to discovery of information concerning other incidents that occurred subsequent to the subject incident as subsequent incidents are irrelevant. Nevertheless, evidence of subsequent incidents is admissible to prove a particular theory of causation, particularly where the exact circumstances of an accident are unknown.</p>
<p id="c0c904ff-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the overbroad nature of Plaintiff’s requests, the Court finds that the requests are unduly burdensome and seek information that is disproportionate to the needs of this case. However, with an appropriate time limitation, a request for accident reports and consumer complaints concerning incidents where the MagicBullet/Nutribullet Pro 900 Series could not be turned off is relevant and proportional to the needs of the case. The Motion to Compel is therefore granted in part, and Defendant shall supplement its response by producing all accident reports and consumer complaints occurring within five years prior to Plaintiff’s incident through the date of Plaintiff’s Complaint concerning incidents where the MagicBullet/Nutribullet Pro 900 Series could not be turned off. <i>See</i> Moore v. Armour Pharmaceutical Co., 927 F.2d 1194, 1197 (11th Cir. 1991) (stating that the trial court “has wide discretion in setting the limits of discovery”); <i>Farnsworth</i>, 758 F.2d at 1547 (same); <i>Commercial Union Ins.

<p id="c0c90509-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wagoner worked as a security guard for Lewis Gale from April 4, 2014 until he was terminated on June 12, 2014. He worked approximately 16 hours per week and earned $12.49 per hour. He filed suit against Lewis Gale on October 23, 2015, <span title="486" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-486">p. 486</span>alleging that he suffered from dyslexia and that Lewis Gale wrongfully terminated his employment in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”).

<p id="c0c9050a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wagoner propounded requests for production of documents to Lewis Gale seeking production of ESI maintained by two custodians, Frank Caballos and Bobby Baker, who were Wagoner’s supervisors. Wagoner limited the dates for any ESI search to only four months and requested the following search terms:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0c9050b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jim OR Wagoner AND dyslexia OR dyslexic OR read OR reading OR slow OR ADA OR disabled OR disability OR security OR schedule OR copy OR copying.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0c9050c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lewis Gale conceded that it does not have the capability to perform this global search and obtained an estimate of $21,570 from a third-party vendor to collect the requested ESI, with an additional $24,000 estimated to review the documents retrieved. The ESI search would involve seven computers that the two custodians had access to and an exchange server located in Tennessee. Lewis Gale argues that the discovery plaintiff seeks is not proportional because Wagoner only worked for two months as a security guard, and his potential damages are less than the cost to perform the ESI search. Lewis Gale further asserts that it has produced considerable ESI in the form of “e-mails gathered manually from the computers of key custodians.”</p>

R. Civ. P. 26(b). Thus, as a threshold matter, I must determine whether Wagoner’s discovery requests are relevant under Rule 26.</p>
<p id="c0c92c21-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wagoner contends that his dyslexia caused him to have difficulty reading and copying his posted work schedule, that Lewis Gale denied his request for a written copy of the schedule, and that his termination violated the ADA. E-mails or other memoranda written by Wagoner’s supervisors, Frank Caballos and Bobby Baker, between April and July 2014 and containing the search terms listed above are relevant to Wagoner’s claim. Indeed, Lewis Gale largely conceded at the hearing that Wagoner’s request was relevant, arguing only that the keyword searches were too broad. Accordingly, I find that Wagoner’s requested ESI search is relevant to the claims and defenses asserted in this case. . . . </p>

<p id="c0c92c23-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lewis Gale argues that the discovery in this case should not be permitted because [it] is not proportional, considering the high cost of performing the ESI search compared to Wagoner’s limited potential recovery. Lewis Gale further states that, if the court does order it to obtain the requested discovery, the court should shift the cost <span title="487" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-487">p. 487</span>of the ESI search to Wagoner. Relevant ESI may still not be discoverable under Rule 26 if the party can show that the information is “not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(B). The court may also specify conditions for the discovery which may include cost sharing. Here I find that Lewis Gale has not shown that the burdens and costs of obtaining the ESI discovery makes the requested information not reasonably accessible, nor has Lewis Gale shown that the requested ESI discovery is not proportional.</p>
<p id="c0c92c24-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lewis Gale claims that the fact that it cannot perform the requested ESI search in-house, and must contract with a third party vendor at significant cost, requires the court to find that the information is not reasonably accessible. Lewis relies upon the declarations of Karyn Hayes, Systems Manager for HCA Management Services, which provides computer systems services to Lewis Gale, and of Austin Maddox, Senior Litigation Technology Consultant for Document Solutions, Inc., the third-party vendor that provided an estimate to Lewis Gale for performing the ESI search. Ms. Hayes indicated that there were approximately 30,598 [responsive] e-mails. . . . She further stated that a third-party vendor would be required to perform the ESI search on seven computers located at Lewis Gale, and the “computers would require forensic extraction of data, data processing, data hosting, project management, production, and review” with an estimated cost of $45,570.00. Mr. Maddox indicated that Wagoner’s ESI request would involve:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0c92c25-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">the remote collection of at least seven laptops and email archive data. The data would be processed and loaded into a Catalyst Repository Systems web-hosted review platform. Once the data has been loaded to Catalyst, the [Document Solutions, Inc.] Client Services team would work with the hospital to cull data through objective filters (date range, email domain, file type, etc.) to identify and promote documents for review by counsel.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0c92c26-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Maddox further estimated that, “Reasonable parameters and metrics suggest that after search terms and date filters have been applied, approximately five gigabytes of data consisting of an estimated 3500 documents per gigabyte would need to be reviewed at an estimated 292 hours of expended time, which would cost approximately $24,000.”</p>
<p id="c0c92c27-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether production of documents is unduly burdensome or expensive turns primarily on whether the data is kept in an accessible or inaccessible format. Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC, 217 F.R.D. 309, 318 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). . . . Lewis Gale has not carried its burden to show that the data on the seven computers or exchange server is inaccessible, i.e. must be restored, de-fragmented, or reconstructed. Instead, Lewis Gale has stated that it is not capable of performing the ESI searches requested by plaintiff in-house, and would be required to contract with an expensive outside vendor.</p>
<p id="c0c92c28-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, it is difficult to conclude that the ESI sought is not proportional or “not reasonably accessible” due to undue burden and expense because Lewis Gale apparently chose to use a system that did not automatically preserve e-mails for more than three days, and did not preserve e-mails in a readily searchable format, making it costly to produce relevant e-mails when faced with a lawsuit. See AAB Joint Venture v. United States, 75 Fed. Cl. 432, 443 (2007) (noting “the Court cannot relieve Defendant of its duty to produce those documents merely because Defendant has chosen a <span title="488" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-488">p. 488</span>means to preserve the evidence which makes ultimate production of relevant documents expensive.”).</p>
<p id="c0c92c29-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Proportionality consists of more than whether the particular discovery method is expensive. Here, Lewis Gale advances no other reasonable alternative to obtain the requested information. Lewis Gale simply proposes to have the very person who may have authored relevant documents search their computer for responsive information. No insurance exists that this search method would yield any ESI deleted prior to the search. Employment discovery presents particular challenges to the employees where most, and sometimes all, relevant discovery is in the control of the employer. Here, in light of the limited request, restricted by custodian, search terms, and time period, I find the request proportional to the needs of the case.</p>
<p id="c0c92c2a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, because I find that the ESI sought is reasonably accessible without undue burden or expense, cost-shifting is not appropriate. Accordingly, I will not shift the cost of discovery, and the general rule that the party responding to a discovery request bears the cost will apply.</p>

<p id="c0c95343-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff, Willy Rengifo (“Rengifo”) [who brings this action against his former employers to recover unpaid overtime wages under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and New York Labor Law, among other claims] requests this Court to issue a protective order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c) barring discovery related to his immigration status, social security number, and authorization to work in the United States. . . . </p>
<p id="c0c95344-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26(c) authorizes courts, for good cause, to “make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including. . . . that certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of the disclosure or discovery be limited to certain matters. . . . ” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c). “[T]he burden is upon the party seeking non-disclosure or a protective order to show good cause.” Dove v. Atlantic Capital Corp., 963 F.2d 15, 19 (2d Cir. 1992) (citations omitted).</p>
<p id="c0c95345-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rengifo argues that discovery related to his immigration status, authorization to work in this country, and social security number are not relevant to his right to recover unpaid wages. Further, Rengifo argues that the intimidating effect of requiring disclosure of immigration status is sufficient to establish “good cause” when the question of immigration status only goes to a collateral issue. Defendants argue that documents containing Rengifo’s social security number or tax identification number, such as tax <span title="489" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-489">p. 489</span>returns, are relevant to the issue of whether he is entitled to overtime wages, which is a central issue in this case. Additionally, defendants argue that the validity of Rengifo’s social security number, his immigration status and authorization to work in this country are relevant to his credibility. . . . </p>
<p id="c0c95346-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts have recognized the <i>in terrorem</i> effect of inquiring into a party’s immigration status and authorization to work in this country when irrelevant to any material claim because it presents a “danger of intimidation [that] would inhibit plaintiffs in pursuing their rights.” Liu v. Donna Karan International, Inc., 207 F. Supp. 2d 191, 193 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (citations omitted). Here, Rengifo’s immigration status and authority to work is a collateral issue. The protective order becomes necessary as “[i]t is entirely likely that any undocumented [litigant] forced to produce documents related to his or her immigration status will withdraw from the suit rather than produce such documents and face. . . . potential deportation.” Topo v. Dhir, 210 F.R.D. 76, 78 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). . . . </p>
<p id="c0c95347-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rengifo also seeks to prevent disclosure of his social security number or tax identification number. Defendants note that, in support of his claim for unpaid overtime wages, Rengifo has produced an incomplete set of pay stubs that do not reflect all of the compensation he has received from corporate defendants, and that he has not produced any records regarding the number of hours he has worked on a weekly basis. Defendants contend, therefore, that discovery of documents containing his tax identification number or social security number, such as tax returns, is necessary and relevant to obtain this information. [The court rejects defendants’ argument, reasoning that t]he information sought is not relevant to the claims in this case. Even if it were, however, the corporate defendants possess relevant data on hours and compensation, and there is no reason to assume that defendants’ records are less reliable than any records maintained by Rengifo. . . . </p>
<p id="c0c95348-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants also assert that the documents requested would allow them to test the truthfulness of Rengifo’s representations to his employer. They argue that by applying for a job and providing his social security number, Rengifo represented to defendants that he was a legal resident and they are entitled to test the truthfulness of that information. Defendants further argue that if Rengifo filed tax returns, this information would be relevant to his overtime claim, but if he failed to file tax returns, this fact would affect the veracity of statements he would potentially make at trial.</p>
<p id="c0c95349-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While it is true that credibility is always at issue, that “does not by itself warrant unlimited inquiry into the subject of immigration status when such examination would impose an undue burden on private enforcement of employment discrimination laws.” Avila-Blum v. Casa de Cambio Delgado, Inc., 236 F.R.D. 190, 192 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). A party’s attempt to discover tax identification numbers on the basis of testing credibility appears to be a back door attempt to learn of immigration status. See E.E.O.C. v. First Wireless Group, Inc., 2007 WL 586720, *2 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 20, 2007). Further, the opportunity to test the credibility of a party based on representations made when seeking employment does not outweigh the chilling effect that disclosure of immigration status has on employees seeking to enforce their rights. “While documented workers face the possibility of retaliatory discharge for an assertion of their <span title="490" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-490">p. 490</span>labor and civil rights, undocumented workers confront the harsher reality that, in addition to possible discharge, their employer will likely report them to the INS and they will be subjected to deportation proceedings or criminal prosecution.” Rivera v. NIBCO, Inc., 364 F.3d 1057, 1064 (9th Cir. 2004). Granting employers the right to inquire into immigration status in employment cases would allow them to implicitly raise threats of such negative consequences when a worker reports illegal practices. <i>Id.</i> at 1065.</p>
<p id="c0c97a5a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While defendants suggest a compromise whereby discovery would be limited to the present litigation and not disclosed to any third party for any purpose beyond this litigation, the limitation does not abate the chilling effect of such disclosure. “Even if the parties were to enter into a confidentiality agreement restricting the disclosure of such discovery. . . . , there would still remain ’the danger of intimidation, the danger of destroying the cause of action’ and would inhibit plaintiffs in pursuing their rights.” <i>Liu,</i> 207 F. Supp. 2d at 193 (<i>quoting</i> Ansoumana v. Gristede’s Operating Corp., 201 F.R.D. 81 (S.D.N.Y. 2001)). This Court finds that defendants’ opportunity to test the credibility of Rengifo does not outweigh the public interest in allowing employees to enforce their rights.</p>
<p id="c0c97a5b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the foregoing reasons, Rengifo’s application for a protective order barring defendants from inquiring into his immigration status, social security number or tax identification number, and authorization to work in the United States is GRANTED.</p>

<li><p id="c0c97a5f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The courts are considering wide-ranging burdens in these cases—time, money, privacy, and even liberty—and weighing those burdens against the likely evidentiary value of the information sought.</p></li>

<li><p id="c0c97a61-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice that all three cases suggest that one must read in context the sentence in Rule 26(c) that says: “The court may, for good cause, issue an order to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. . . . ” Much clearly discoverable material is embarrassing to a party or person (I’m embarrassed to admit I ran the red light, but cannot on that ground get a protective order). The sentence needs to be read in conjunction with Rule 26(b)(1)—making much “annoy[ing or] embarrass[ing]” material discoverable so long as it is relevant, unprivileged, and proportional to the needs of the case.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0c9a182-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Protective orders are commonly used, but will not solve all clashes between the broad scope of discovery and parties’ interests in keeping certain matters confidential. In <i>Rengifo</i> the court considered and then rejected the possibility of using a protective order because disclosure of information about Rengifo’s immigration status would be chilling whether or not it was under seal. Another example arose in connection with Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Coca-Cola Co., 107 F.R.D. 288 (D. Del. 1985), in which Coca-Cola bottlers sued the manufacturer over the division of profits from Diet Coke. The primary issue in contention was “whether the contractual term ’Coca-Cola Bottler’s Syrup’ includes the syrup used to make Diet Coke.” Id. at 289. The bottlers contended that the question could be resolved by discovering the ingredients used in both drinks. The defendant manufacturer strongly resisted the effort, for reasons the opinion explains:</p>

<p id="c0c9c89a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26(b)(1) contains an explicit exception to its broad scope: It makes discoverable only “any <i>nonprivileged</i> matter that is relevant  . . . ” (emphasis added). Claims of privilege differ sharply from those grounded in proportionality and privacy. Unless waived (see below), privileges are absolute—it makes no difference that one party desperately needs the information and that it would cost nothing to disclose it; privilege is an absolute bar to discovery.</p>
<p id="c0c9c89b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So what are privileges? The law of evidence—not discovery rules—creates privileges, and you will study them in Evidence. For now a brief sketch will supply enough information to let us explore how the discovery system protects privileges.</p>
<p id="c0c9c89c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Very briefly, one can say that privileges typically protect information <i>from certain sources</i>. For example, in a criminal case the prosecutor cannot call the defendant to the stand and ask her if she committed the crime; such an action would violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Privileges would also protect a party’s communications with an attorney, a doctor, a member of the clergy, or a spouse. These privileges are premised on the notion that it is important to protect free communication with these sorts of people, no matter how beneficial the information would be to the public. Notice first that a privilege objection has nothing to do with relevance: whether the defendant committed the crime is highly relevant. Second, notice that although privileges typically block information from a particular source, they do not block the underlying facts. Thus, in the prosecution of a criminal case, the prosecutor will be barred by the Fifth Amendment from asking the defendant about her guilt, and barred by the attorney-client privilege from asking similar questions of her lawyer, but can introduce evidence proving the defendant’s guilt from other, unprivileged sources.</p>
<p id="c0c9c89d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A notable characteristic of evidentiary privileges is that they are not self- actuating. In other words, privileges will have effect only if a party asserts them. Moreover, privileges, even if asserted, can later be waived. To use (yet another!) illustration from <i>Haddle v. Garrison</i>, suppose in a deposition or at trial, Haddle’s lawyer <span title="493" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-493">p. 493</span>asks Garrison, “What did you tell your lawyer about why you fired Michael Haddle?” If Garrison’s lawyer objects on privilege grounds, Garrison will not have to answer the question. But if—hard as it is to imagine—no objection is raised and Garrison answers the question, the attorney-client privilege will be waived, and Garrison can be asked additional questions about her communications with her lawyer. And, of course, no question of privilege arises if Garrison is simply asked, “Why did you fire Haddle?” (regardless of whether Garrison discussed this topic with her lawyer).</p>
<p id="c0c9c89e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Waiver can also result from taking some action inconsistent with claiming the privilege—such as disclosing privileged material to a third party. For example, suppose that well before suit was filed, Garrison told a friend about a conversation she had with her lawyer: That action will likely be held to be a waiver of the privilege that would otherwise apply. And, very important for our purposes, parties can waive privileges by taking certain stances in litigation. For example, Haddle waives his doctor-patient privilege with his psychologist because he has put his emotional state at issue in his suit against Garrison. Discussing all of the privileges and the conditions for their invocation and waiver would take us far beyond the scope of a course in Civil Procedure. Our focus instead is on the interaction of privileges and discovery in civil lawsuits.</p>

The general rules on waiver of privilege are straightforward, and are incorporated in Rule 502 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Any privilege may be waived. Production of a privileged document—even if inadvertent—or testimony about a privileged conversation will operate as a waiver, and prevent a party from asserting the privilege as to any other privileged communications on the same subject matter, with subject matter interpreted very broadly. The purpose of this Rule is to prohibit a party from selectively waiving the privilege—that is, producing some privileged documents that tend to support the party’s position, but withholding as privileged other documents that would tend to undercut the party’s position.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0c9efba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When privileged documents may be mixed in among nonprivileged documents, the possibility of waiver of privilege requires the producing party to review all of the documents before production, and to remove any documents that could be claimed to be privileged. Any documents removed from production based on a claim of privilege must then be listed on a “privilege log” provided to the party requesting the documents. The privilege log must provide sufficient information about the document to allow the requesting party to assess the claim of privilege and decide whether to contest the claim. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0c9efbb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These principles all worked reasonably smoothly in the world before the copy machine and digital devices. But they create major problems in an information age. In some cases, thousands or millions of documents need to be reviewed before production because of the remote possibility that one or a few of them might be privileged. If any one of the produced documents is deemed to have been privileged, even if innocuous itself, its production could be deemed to constitute a waiver of privilege as to all other documents and oral communications on the same broad subject matter. There are few things a lawyer fears more than a court determining that his production of a privileged document in discovery operated as a waiver of the privilege as to all of his communications with his client.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0c9efbc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26(b)(5)(B) tries to address this problem of inadvertent disclosure with what has come to be known in the profession as a “claw-back” provision. Read it while hoping fervently that you will never need to be the party doing the “clawing.” Rule 16, dealing with pretrial conferences, scheduling, and case management, also allows the court to consider agreements “for asserting claims of privilege. . . . after production.”</p></li>

The topic to which we turn balances discovery needs with another social value—an adversarial legal system. Our system requires both that parties disclose potentially harmful information to their adversaries while simultaneously encouraging a competitive stance.</p>

Garrison asks Haddle’s lawyer what documents he reviewed before drafting the complaint. Note that this is not covered by lawyer-client privilege. But, under well-established principles, Garrison will not get those documents absent special circumstances. The next case, still fundamental in the area, tries to explain why. It may be helpful to note that when <i>Hickman v. Taylor</i> was decided, the Rules had no provision covering trial preparation materials. (Rule 26(b)(3) did not become effective until 1970.)</p>

<p id="c0ca16d6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case presents an important problem under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as to the extent to which a party may inquire into oral and written statements of witnesses, or other information, secured by an adverse party’s counsel in the course of preparation for possible litigation after a claim has arisen. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ca16d7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 7, 1943, the tug “J.M. Taylor” sank while engaged in helping to tow a car float of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad across the Delaware River at Philadelphia. The accident was apparently unusual in nature, the cause of it still being unknown. Five of the nine crew members were drowned. Three days later the tug owners and the underwriters employed a law firm, of which respondent Fortenbaugh is a member, to defend them against potential suits by representatives of the deceased crew members and to sue the railroad for damages to the tug.</p>
<p id="c0ca16d8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A public hearing was held on March 4, 1943, before the United States Steamboat Inspectors, at which the four survivors were examined. This testimony was recorded and made available to all interested parties. Shortly thereafter, Fortenbaugh privately interviewed the survivors and took statements from them with an eye toward the anticipated litigation; the survivors signed these statements on March 29. Fortenbaugh also interviewed other persons believed to have some information relating to the accident and in some cases he made memoranda of what they told him. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ca16d9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[One of the survivors sued, and his lawyer] filed 39 interrogatories directed to the tug owners. The 38th interrogatory read: “State whether any statements of the members of the crews of the Tugs ’J.M. Taylor’ and ’Philadelphia’ or of any other vessel were taken in connection with the towing of the car float and the sinking of the <span title="496" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-496">p. 496</span>Tug ’John M.

<p id="c0ca16da-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Supplemental interrogatories asked whether any oral or written statements, records, reports, or other memoranda had been made concerning any matter relative to the towing operation, the sinking of the tug, the salvaging and repair of the tug, and the death of the deceased. If the answer was in the affirmative, the tug owners were then requested to set forth the nature of all such records, reports, statements, or other memoranda.</p>
<p id="c0ca16db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The tug owners, through Fortenbaugh, answered all of the interrogatories except No. 38 and the supplemental ones just described. While admitting that statements of the survivors had been taken, they declined to summarize or set forth the contents [claiming] that such requests called “for privileged matter obtained in preparation for litigation” and constituted “an attempt to obtain indirectly counsel’s private files.” It was claimed that answering these requests “would involve practically turning over not only the complete files, but also the telephone records and, almost, the thoughts of counsel.”. . . . [The district court held that the requested matters were not privileged and ordered Fortenbaugh to produce the requested statements. He refused, and the court ordered him imprisoned until he complied (but stayed the order pending an appeal).]</p>
<p id="c0ca16dc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The pre-trial deposition-discovery mechanism established by Rules 26 to 37 is one of the most significant innovations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. . . . Under the prior federal practice, the pre-trial functions of notice-giving issue-formulation and fact-revelation were performed primarily and inadequately by the pleadings. Inquiry into the issues and the facts before trial was narrowly confined and was often cumbersome in method. The new rules, however, restrict the pleadings to the task of general notice-giving and invest the deposition-discovery process with a vital role in the preparation for trial. . . . Thus civil trials in the federal courts no longer need be carried on in the dark. The way is now clear, consistent with recognized privileges, for the parties to obtain the fullest possible knowledge of the issues and facts before trial. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ca16dd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree, of course, that the deposition-discovery rules are to be accorded a broad and liberal treatment. No longer can the time-honored cry of “fishing expedition” serve to preclude a party from inquiring into the facts underlying his opponent’s case. Mutual knowledge of all the relevant facts gathered by both parties is essential to proper litigation. To that end, either party may compel the other to disgorge whatever facts he has in his possession. The deposition-discovery procedure simply advances the stage at which the disclosure can be compelled from the time of trial to the period preceding it, thus reducing the possibility of surprise. But discovery, like all matters of procedure, has ultimate and necessary boundaries. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ca3dee-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We. . . . agree that the memoranda, statements and mental impressions in issue in this case fall outside the scope of the attorney-client privilege and hence are not protected from discovery on that basis. . . . [T]he protective cloak of this privilege does not extend to information which an attorney secures from a witness while <span title="497" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-497">p. 497</span>acting for his client in anticipation of litigation. Nor does this privilege concern the memoranda, briefs, communications and other writings prepared by counsel for his own use in prosecuting his client’s case; and it is equally unrelated to writings which reflect an attorney’s mental impressions, conclusions, opinions or legal theories.</p>
<p id="c0ca3def-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the impropriety of invoking that privilege does not provide an answer to the problem before us. Petitioner has made more than an ordinary request for relevant, non-privileged facts in the possession of his adversaries or their counsel. He has sought discovery as of right of oral and written statements of witnesses whose identity is well known and whose availability to petitioner appears unimpaired. He has sought production of these matters after making the most searching inquiries of his opponents as to the circumstances surrounding the fatal accident, which inquiries were sworn to have been answered to the best of their information and belief. Interrogatories were directed toward all the events prior to, during and subsequent to the sinking of the tug. Full and honest answers to such broad inquiries would necessarily have included all pertinent information gleaned by Fortenbaugh through his interviews with the witnesses. Petitioner makes no suggestion, and we cannot assume, that the tug owners or Fortenbaugh were incomplete or dishonest in the framing of their answers. In addition, petitioner was free to examine the public testimony of the witnesses taken before the United States Steamboat Inspectors. We are thus dealing with an attempt to secure the production of written statements and mental impressions contained in the files and the mind of the attorney Fortenbaugh without any showing of necessity or any indication or claim that denial of such production would unduly prejudice the preparation of petitioner’s case or cause him any hardship or injustice. For aught that appears, the essence of what petitioner seeks either has been revealed to him already through the interrogatories or is readily available to him direct from the witnesses for the asking. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ca3df0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our opinion, neither Rule 26 nor any other rule dealing with discovery contemplates production under such circumstances. . . . Not even the most liberal of discovery theories can justify unwarranted inquiries into the files and the mental impressions of an attorney.</p>
<p id="c0ca3df1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Historically, a lawyer is an officer of the court and is bound to work for the advancement of justice while faithfully protecting the rightful interests of his clients. In performing his various duties, however, it is essential that a lawyer work with a certain degree of privacy, free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing parties and their counsel. Proper preparation of a client’s case demands that he assemble information, sift what he considers to be the relevant from the irrelevant facts, prepare his legal theories and plan his strategy without undue and needless interference. That is the historical and the necessary way in which lawyers act within the framework of our system of jurisprudence to promote justice and to protect their clients’ interests. This work is reflected, of course, in interviews, statements, memoranda, correspondence, briefs, mental impressions, personal beliefs, and countless other tangible and intangible ways—aptly though roughly termed by the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case as the “work product of the lawyer.” Were such materials open to opposing counsel on mere demand, much of what is now put down in writing would remain <span title="498" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-498">p. 498</span>unwritten. An attorney’s thoughts, heretofore inviolate, would not be his own. Inefficiency, unfairness and sharp practices would inevitably develop in the giving of legal advice and in the preparation of cases for trial. The effect on the legal profession would be demoralizing. And the interests of the clients and the cause of justice would be poorly served.</p>
<p id="c0ca3df2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not mean to say that all written materials obtained or prepared by an adversary’s counsel with an eye toward litigation are necessarily free from discovery in all cases. Where relevant and non-privileged facts remain hidden in an attorney’s file and where production of those facts is essential to the preparation of one’s case, discovery may properly be had. Such written statements and documents might, under certain circumstances, be admissible in evidence or give clues as to the existence or location of relevant facts. Or they might be useful for purposes of impeachment or corroboration. And production might be justified where the witnesses are no longer available or can be reached only with difficulty. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ca3df3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But as to oral statements made by witnesses to Fortenbaugh, whether presently in the form of his mental impressions or memoranda, we do not believe that any showing of necessity can be made under the circumstances of this case so as to justify production. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ca3df4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Denial of production of this nature does not mean that any material, non- privileged facts can be hidden from the petitioner in this case. He need not be unduly hindered in the preparation of his case, in the discovery of facts or in his anticipation of his opponents’ position. Searching interrogatories directed to Fortenbaugh and the tug owners, production of written documents and statements upon a proper showing and direct interviews with the witnesses themselves all serve to reveal the facts in Fortenbaugh’s possession to the fullest possible extent consistent with public policy. Petitioner’s counsel frankly admits that he wants the oral statements only to help prepare himself to examine witnesses and to make sure that he has overlooked nothing. That is insufficient under the circumstances to permit him an exception to the policy underlying the privacy of Fortenbaugh’s professional activities. If there should be a rare situation justifying production of these matters, petitioner’s case is not of that type. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ca3df5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span class="epub-small-caps">Jackson</span>, J., concurring. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ca3df6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Counsel for the petitioner candidly said on argument that he wanted this information to help prepare himself to examine witnesses, to make sure he overlooked nothing. He bases his claim to it in his brief on the view that the Rules were to do away with the old situation where a law suit developed into “a battle of wits between counsel.” But a common law trial is and always should be an adversary proceeding. Discovery was hardly intended to enable a learned profession to perform its functions either without wits or on wits borrowed from the adversary.</p>
<p id="c0ca3df7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The real purpose and the probable effect of the practice ordered by the district court would be to put trials on a level even lower than a “battle of wits.” I can conceive of no practice more demoralizing to the Bar than to require a lawyer to write out and deliver to his adversary an account of what witnesses have told him. . . . </p>

One way to think of trial preparation material is as rough drafts of that story—drafts that may be discarded or revised as thought and information come to it. Eventually, at summary judgment or trial, the lawyer will need to settle on a coherent story and tell it in public. Until that happens, trial preparation protection lets the lawyer keep the rough drafts to herself—unless special circumstances exist.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0ca8b28-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the time of <i>Hickman</i>, Rule 26 did not deal specifically with the topic of trial preparation materials.

The Rules also incorporate the qualified nature of protections for trial preparation materials, allowing disclosure of the information if its substantial equivalent cannot be obtained without significant hardship. See Rules 26(b)(3) and 26(b)(4)(D).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ca8b29-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26(b)(3) protects from disclosure “documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or its representatives.” Not surprisingly, disputes arise over whether a document has been prepared “in anticipation of litigation.” A diary entry, written by a party, is unlikely to fall in this category; notes from a lawyer’s interview of that party most certainly will. Although both may concern the incident that gives rise to litigation, only the latter was prepared in anticipation of that litigation. There are also closer questions concerning whether internal reports of incidents were made as part of the regular course of business or in anticipation of litigation. Suppose that in <i>Haddle v. Garrison</i> Healthmaster has a Human Resources department and someone from that department interviewed Haddle shortly before he was fired and wrote a report. Prepared in anticipation of litigation? Compare Rakus v. Erie-Lackawanna Railroad, 76 F.R.D. 145 (W.D.N.Y. 1977) (employees’ accident reports to claims department are discoverable) and Nesselrotte v. Allegheny Energy Inc., 242 F.R.D. 338 (W.D.

<p id="c0cab242-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another specialized form of trial preparation involves expert witnesses and, as with trial preparation, the Rules call out expert testimony for special treatment. Experts enter civil litigation in two ways. In some cases experts may participate in events that give rise to litigation. Imagine that City designs and builds a bridge over a busy road connecting two parts of a university campus; the bridge later collapses, killing a number of people. Wrongful death litigation may focus on flaws in design and construction. In such a case the engineers and builders who designed and built the bridge, though experts in their fields, will be “fact witnesses” in the same way as those who saw it collapse. These experts will be subject to all the ordinary stages of discovery and will for the most part be treated in the same way as a bystander who witnessed the bridge’s collapse.</p>
<p id="c0cab243-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second kind of expert—the kind on which the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure focus—enters the picture if parties in the bridge collapse hire experts—to testify, for example, about the design or construction of the bridge. Experts hired (or “retained” in the more elegant language of the Rules) for the purposes of litigation can range from the standard professionals—physicians, accountants, engineers—to experts in “accident reconstruction” and “brand name identification.” Such hired experts typically testify to the inferences one can draw about the causes or effects of an event by applying their special knowledge to the information available.</p>
<p id="c0cab244-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to understand the procedural rules applicable to this second type of expert, it may help to have a quick sketch of how lawyers might use them in litigation. Let’s return to the bridge collapse scenario as a framework. If litigation ensues, both sides will likely want to use engineers’ testimony. The City might want an engineer to support a possible argument the bridge was in all ways properly designed but the contractor it hired cut corners that caused the collapse; the plaintiff will likely want to show that the City’s design was based on a new and insufficiently tested concept that proved defective. To support these duelling contentions the parties will seek out independent experts—perhaps from civil engineering faculties of universities (other than the one affected, of course). Locating and hiring such experts is an important part of case preparation: One wants not only someone with impressive credentials but someone who will make a good impression on the trier of fact. Having located such a person, each lawyer will have initial consultations, presenting their expert with information relating to the bridge’s design. And here things can go well or badly. Well if the expert’s initial impressions support the lawyer’s theory; badly if the expert thinks otherwise—or seems unlikely to make the right impression on a judge or <span title="502" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-502">p. 502</span>jury. Even if all goes well with the expert, her report is likely to go through multiple drafts as the expert and the lawyer shape it to support a persuasive claim or defense. As we’ll see, Rule 26(b)(4) now takes account of each of these possibilities.</p>
<p id="c0cab245-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Just as Rule 26(a) requires parties to disclose witnesses and information they may use to support their claims, Rule 26(a)(2) sets requirements for disclosure of expert witnesses. Rule 26(a)(2)(D) requires that 90 days before trial (or 30 days for rebuttal testimony) the parties identify experts who may testify. This disclosure rule reflects the expectation that lawyers will want to depose the other side’s expert—most likely after consulting with their own.</p>
<p id="c0cab246-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26(a)(2) then implicitly divides experts into two groups: experts who must provide an elaborate written report (26(a)(2)(B)) and those who need not (26(a)(2)(C)). The division roughly corresponds to the distinction made above—between “fact witness” experts (e.g., the engineers who designed the bridge in the hypothetical above) and those who were hired specially for the lawsuit (e.g., engineers hired to testify about proper bridge design). The latter must produce an elaborate written report, the former not. But, because even non-retained experts are experts, and it will be very difficult for the opposing lawyer effectively to depose or examine them, Rule 26(a)(2)(C) requires, as part of the pretrial disclosures, that even “fact witness” experts summarize “facts and opinions” to which they expect to testify. (The Rule is silent as to who will write this summary, and one imagines that, in practice, it will often be the lawyers who want to call the witnesses.) After producing their report, experts can be deposed by opposing counsel. Rules 26(a)(2), 26(b)(4). These reports and the ensuing depositions will often be the last significant discovery events.</p>
<p id="c0cab247-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Expert witnesses can serve a third role in litigation; as advisers to the attorney who retained them. Sometimes experts (jury consultants, for example) may be hired in anticipation of litigation but with no expectation of ever testifying at trial. Other times, an expert might be consulted with the expectation that he would testify at trial—he might even prepare a report—but the lawyer might decide not to call him as a witness.</p>
<p id="c0cab248-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26(b)(4) addresses work product problems surrounding experts. The Rule contains special provisions for retained experts and their communications with lawyers as they prepare their reports and testimony. Both the defense and plaintiff bars agree that it is important to extend work product protection to drafts of experts’ opinions; the current Rule does so. Rule 26(b)(4)(D) protects reports and opinions by witnesses retained in anticipation of litigation who will not testify, with exceptions similar to those in Rule 23(b)(3) for trial preparation materials.</p>

<p id="c0cad96d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This cause is before the Court on Plaintiff’s Motion for Protective Order filed on May 13, 1994 (hereinafter Motion). Plaintiff seeks to shield from discovery documents related to her in the possession of Lauren Lucas, Ph.D., a psychologist. She contends that Rule 26(b)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) protects the psychological records in Dr. Lucas’ possession. In particular, Plaintiff represents Dr. Lucas was retained by her prior counsel to perform a diagnostic review and personality profile, and that, after seeing Plaintiff on one occasion on June 15, 1992, Dr. Lucas prepared a report for her prior counsel.</p>

</div>
<p id="c0cad972-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming arguendo that Dr. Lucas’ report is covered by Rule 26(b)(4), it would nevertheless be discoverable under the circumstances presented in this case. In the instant lawsuit, Plaintiff alleges that, as a result of sexual harassment by co-defendant Zona, a supervisor in the employ of the Defendant, she was “reduced to a severely depressed emotional state and her employment was terminated when she did not acquiesce to the advances of [Zona].” According to a complaint filed with the Jacksonville Equal Opportunity Commission, Plaintiff apparently was terminated from her position with Defendant Haskell Company on June 5, 1992. Thus, her mental and emotional state ten days later on June 15, 1992, the date on which she was examined by Dr. Lucas, is highly probative with regard to the above-quoted allegation, which is essential to her case.</p>
<p id="c0cad973-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This highly probative information is discoverable notwithstanding Rule 26(b)(4), moreover, given the nature of the report at issue. Apparently, no other comparable report was prepared during the weeks immediately following Plaintiff’s discharge. Thus, the Defendant could not obtain the information contained in Dr. Lucas’ report by other means. In a case almost on all fours with the instant one, the Court recognized that even “independent examinations. . . . pursuant to Rule 35 would not <span title="505" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-505">p. 505</span>contain equivalent information.” Dixon v. Cappellini, 88 F.R.D. 1, 3 (M.D. Pa. 1980). Under these facts, it appears there are exceptional circumstances favoring disclosure of Dr. Lucas’ report, and that the Defendant could not obtain comparable information by other means.

<p id="c0cad979-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a maritime action in which the shipper, Chiquita International Ltd. (“Chiquita”), sues the carrier, International Reefer Services, S.A. (“International Reefer”), for cargo loss and damage. Chiquita alleges that International Reefer was engaged to transport 154,660 boxes of bananas from Puerto Bolivar, Ecuador to Bremerhaven, Germany aboard the M/V Bolero Reefer. However, because of alleged malfunctions of the vessel’s loading cranes and side-ports, only 111,660 boxes were loaded. Thus, 43,000 boxes of bananas were left on the wharf and were later disposed of. The cargo that did arrive in Germany was allegedly in poor condition.</p>
<p id="c0cad97a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">International Reefer has submitted a letter in support of an application to compel discovery of Joseph Winer. Mr. Winer is a marine surveyor [a type of expert familiar with ship design and maintenance] who examined the vessel and loading gear at Chiquita’s request shortly after the vessel arrived in Bremerhaven. International Reefer seeks Mr. Winer’s deposition and production of the file he assembled in connection with his inspection. Chiquita has objected to these demands on the ground that Mr. Winer is a non-testifying expert as to whom discovery is closely circumscribed by Rule 26(b)(4)([D]) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. International Reefer replies that Mr. Winer is a fact witness rather than an expert. Moreover, even if he is an expert, International Reefer argues that the fact that he is the only surveyor who observed the vessel shortly after it docked is an exceptional circumstance warranting discovery. . . . </p>
<p id="c0cad97b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The opinion quotes Rule 26(b)(4)(D).]</p>
<p id="c0cad97c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A] non-testifying expert is generally immune from discovery.</p>
<p id="c0cad97d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Winer qualifies as such an expert. He is a marine engineer who was specifically engaged by Chiquita to examine the vessel in connection with the cargo loss claim. He is clearly an “expert” in that he brought his technical background to bear in observing the condition of the gear and offering his opinion to Chiquita. He does not forfeit this status merely because he made a personal examination of the vessel and therefore learned “facts,” rather than simply offering an opinion based on the observations of others. Rule 26(b)(4)[(D)] generally precludes discovery of “facts known or opinions” held by a non-testifying expert, and so it anticipates that such an expert may make his or her own investigation. Thus, the relevant distinction is not between fact and opinion testimony but between those witnesses whose information was obtained in the normal course of business and those who were hired to make an evaluation in connection with expected litigation. See Harasimowicz v. McAllister, 78 F.R.D. 319, 320 (E.D. Pa. 1978) (medical examiner subject to ordinary discovery on <span title="506" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-506">p. 506</span>routine autopsy); Congrove v. St. Louis-San Francisco Railway, 77 F.R.D. 503, 504-05 (W.D. Mo. 1978) (treating physician subject to ordinary discovery). Here, Mr. Winer falls into the latter category and Rule 26(b)(4)[(D)] therefore applies.</p>
<p id="c0cad97e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">International Reefer nevertheless contends that discovery should be permitted under the “exceptional circumstances” clause of the rule, since no other marine surveyor viewed the vessel shortly after docking. This argument would have merit if International Reefer had been precluded from sending its own expert to the scene by forces beyond its control. Thus, for example, in [another case] the court found there to be exceptional circumstances where the plaintiff allowed its own expert to examine the item at issue while barring the defendant’s experts until the item was no longer accessible.</p>
<p id="c0cb008f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, that is not the case here. The vessel and equipment were at least as available to International Reefer as to Chiquita from the time of loading. Indeed, during the three-week voyage to Bremerhaven, International Reefer’s employees had the exclusive opportunity to examine the loading cranes. Under these circumstances, the failure of International Reefer to engage its own marine surveyor in a timely manner should not be rewarded by permitting discovery of Chiquita’s expert. To do so would permit the exceptional circumstances exception to swallow Rule 26(b)(4)[(D)].</p>
<p id="c0cb0090-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, International Reefer maintains that even if it is foreclosed from deposing Mr. Winer, it should be given access to his file. However, Rule 26(b)(4)[(D)] applies to document discovery as well as to depositions. Nevertheless, International Reefer is correct that information does not become exempt from discovery merely because it is conveyed to a non-testifying expert. Thus, while the file may contain Mr. Winer’s recorded observations and opinions which need not be disclosed, it may also include discoverable information provided to Mr. Winer by others. Such documents shall be produced.</p>

<p id="c0cb27b1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With all this guidance from Rules and case law, what could possibly go wrong? Plenty, it turns out. We do not know how often discovery results in controversy and conflict. A survey conducted by the nonpartisan Federal Judicial Center in 2009 found that lawyers on both sides of the “v” reported that “the disclosure and discovery [in their cases] generated ’the right amount’ of information” and that “expenditures for discovery, including attorney fees, amounted at the median 1.6% of the reported stakes for plaintiff[s] and 3.3% [for defendants].”</p>
<p id="c0cb27b2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, even a cursory review of federal district court opinions reveals all sorts of bad behavior during discovery. Delay, evasiveness, abusive use of various discovery devices, use of discovery to buy time or to force a hard-pressed opponent to settle for less, are just some tactics that can be observed. Such depressing behavior has several sources, some of which lie in the design of the discovery system itself. The Federal Rules envisioned discovery would operate largely without judicial supervision, and the Rules therefore speak of lawyers exchanging various discovery requests without intervention by courts. There is a debate within the profession <span title="508" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-508">p. 508</span>about whether and how much judges should become involved with discovery early in a lawsuit, but at present that remains a judge’s choice rather than a command of the Rules.</p>

<p id="c0cb4ec5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before assessing the effectiveness of court interventions, it may help to understand some types of disagreements that become full-fledged discovery disputes. One common subject of dispute is the proper scope of discovery. Reverting to the hypothetical in Chapter 1, imagine that Peters has sued Dodge for injuries resulting from an auto accident. Dodge asks Peters for documents reflecting all of Peters’s medical treatments for the past ten years. Peters objects: He believes that the request is overbroad—not “proportionate” in the language of Rule 26(b)(1)—and that at least some of the documents requested are privileged. Dodge maintains that the request is appropriate, as past medical records would indicate whether some of the injuries claimed by Peters predated the accident. In Peters’s view, Dodge has abused the discovery tools by asking for more information than the claim justifies. In Dodge’s view, Peters is stonewalling—resisting appropriate requests for discovery.</p>
<p id="c0cb4ec6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second common subject of dispute concerns whether a party has lost or destroyed important evidence. Until recently, the Rules did not expressly address this type of problem, but the common law did. Now, the Rules do as well, at least concerning electronic discovery. Read Rule 37(e). Under the common law and now the Rules, parties are obligated to preserve evidence relevant to pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation. The failure to preserve or destruction of this type of evidence is called <i>spoliation</i>. Recall <i>Zubulake</i>, with which this chapter began: an employment discrimination case in which the plaintiff accused the defendant of destroying some e-mails relevant to the case.</p>

<p id="c0cb4ec9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All discovery methods need enforcement mechanisms. The Rules provide means of enforcing compliance by both the propounding and the answering party. Rule 26(g), like Rule 11, requires that discovery requests and responses be signed, and states that the signature implies discovery requests are reasonable and discovery responses are complete. Unlike Rule 11, Rule 26(g) suggests that attorneys’ fees will be an appropriate sanction for most violations of its obligations.</p>
<p id="c0cb4eca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 37 establishes a system of sanctions for parties violating more specific obligations. Under that Rule, a court may impose punishments ranging from awards of expenses to dismissals of an entire case or the entry of a default judgment. Some sanctions are available on the occurrence of misbehavior. See Rule 37(d), (f). Other sanctions cannot be sought until after the court has ordered a party to comply, but it has refused. See Rule 37(b). And, as we have discussed, the failure to preserve electronically stored information has its own rule regarding sanctions. See Rule 37(e).</p>

Discovery proceeds on the assumption that these are the relevant witnesses, but when plaintiff discloses the list of trial witnesses as required by Rule 26(a)(3), a new name appears. Are sanctions available? On what theory? What sanctions? See Rule 37(c).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0cb4ecf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contract dispute between plaintiff (Supplier) and defendant (Producer), with the parties’ understanding of a clause at issue. Supplier serves a request for production requesting “all memoranda, e-mails, and internal correspondence” regarding the contract in question. If Producer believes that the request for production is overbroad, what should it do? See Rule 26(b)(2)(C). If Producer produces only one memo, and Supplier believes there are many more, what should it do? See Rule 37(a). How might this dispute lead to sanctions, according to Rule 37(b)?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0cb4ed0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Same contract dispute.

First, suppose that Producer simply fails to respond to the request. What steps must Supplier follow to force Producer either to comply or suffer sanctions? Read carefully Rule 37(a)(1)-(3). See Shuffle Master Inc. v. Progressive Games, Inc., 170 F.R.D. 166 (D.

Now suppose two of the documents covered by the request happen to be letters from Producer’s lawyer to Producer, answering questions about the interpretation of the contract in question; Producer believes that both documents are protected by the attorney-client privilege. How should Producer raise that objection? See Rules 26(c) and 37(a). If the parties cannot agree on whether the documents are privileged, each has an option: Supplier can move to compel production of the document, and Producer can resist by asserting privilege. Or, Producer can move for a protective order under Rule 26(c) and Supplier can resist the motion by arguing that the letters are not privileged. If you were representing Supplier, which path would you prefer? If you were representing Producer?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0cb75eb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, consider a court’s ability to impose sanctions for discovery-related conduct not flowing directly from any particular discovery Rule. Federal courts have inherent powers “to fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process.” Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 44-45 (1991). Such abuse might include but is not limited to misconduct in discovery. But—the Supreme Court has held—when a court awards attorneys’ fees as part of such a sanction, such fees must be limited to those actually caused by the misconduct, and cannot be awarded as an all-purpose punishment for bad behavior.

Read Rule 37(b)(2); it gives courts wide latitude to determine appropriate sanctions for discovery violations, including dismissal of claims, limiting the evidence parties can use at trial, and awards of attorneys’ fees. Yet Rule 37 places additional limits on a court’s ability to impose sanctions for “electronically stored information that should have been preserved in anticipation of litigation.” <span title="511" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-511">p. 511</span>The Rule imposes two principal limits: In (e)(1) it specifies that sanctions be “not greater than necessary to cure the prejudice” produced by the missing records; in (e)(2) it requires, for the imposition of the most serious sanctions, a finding that “the party acted with the intent to deprive another party of the information’s use in litigation.” The latter amendment was criticized at the time of its proposal, on the ground that it encouraged parties to be “merely” negligent in their preservation efforts.

Now before the Court is Plaintiff’s Motion for Sanctions for Plaintiff’s Spoliation of Evidence. As explained below, Defendants’ Motion is granted in part, to impose a spoliation sanction that is less harsh than the adverse inference requested by Defendants, but which the Court finds is the most appropriate sanction in the circumstances of this case. . . . </p>
<p id="c0cb9d05-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he additional background set out below is both undisputed and supported by evidence in the record. Plaintiff worked as an on-air radio personality for a Denver area radio station, KYGO. On June 2, 2013, he attended a backstage “meet and greet” preceding a concert performed by Swift at Denver’s Pepsi Center. As detailed in the summary judgment order, Swift alleges that during a staged photo opportunity at the “meet and greet,” Plaintiff purposefully and inappropriately touched her buttocks beneath her dress. Plaintiff denies having done so.</p>
<p id="c0cb9d06-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff’s employer, the company that owned KYGO, was informed of Swift’s accusation on the evening of June 2, 2013 and on the following day. On June 3, 2013, Plaintiff met with his superiors at KYGO, including Robert Call (“Call”) and Hershel Coomer (a/k/a “Eddie Haskell”) (“Haskell”). Unbeknownst to Call and Haskell at the time, Plaintiff made an audio recording of their conversation. The following day, June 4, 2013, Plaintiff was terminated from his employment at KYGO by Call. Call explained that one reason for Plaintiff’s termination was because Call perceived Plaintiff had “changed his story that it couldn’t have occurred, then that it was incidental.”</p>
<p id="c0cb9d07-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At some point thereafter, well after having first contacted an attorney regarding potential legal action, Plaintiff edited the audio recording of the June 3, 2013 conversation, and then sent only “clips” of the entire audio file to his attorney. In his deposition testimony, Plaintiff offered the following explanation for these actions: “[t]he audio I recorded was close to two hours long. And the audio that I could provide to [Plaintiff’s counsel] was a portion of the entire audio,” and “it was so long, that I edited down clips from the recording to provide to [Plaintiff’s counsel] to give an idea of what kind of questioning I went. . . . through.”</p>
<p id="c0cb9d08-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to his testimony, Plaintiff edited the audio file on his laptop computer, on which he also retained a full copy of the original audio file(s).

Plaintiff took the laptop to the Apple Store, and was given “a new machine.” He did not keep the original hard drive or recover the files from it. Evidently this occurred sometime in 2015. In addition, although Plaintiff kept an external hard drive “to store audio files and documents,” and the complete audio recording was saved on this drive, at some point it “stopped working.” At his deposition, Plaintiff testified that he “may have kept” this hard drive, but that because it was “useless” he “[didn’t] know if I discarded it because it was junk.” It has not been produced.</p>
<p id="c0cb9d09-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The end result of all this is that the complete audio recording of the June 3, 2013 conversation among Plaintiff, Call, and Haskell has never been produced. . . . As a result, Defendants move for a Court-imposed sanction for spoliation of evidence, and in particular for the Court to give the jury an adverse inference instruction at trial, to direct the jury “that the entirety of the June 3, 2013 audio recording would have been unfavorable to Plaintiff.”</p>
<p id="c0cb9d0a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“A spoliation sanction is proper where: ‘(1) a party has a duty to preserve evidence because it knew, or should have known, that litigation was imminent, and (2) the adverse party was prejudiced by the destruction of the evidence.’” In deciding whether to sanction a party for the spoliation of evidence, courts have considered a variety of factors, but two “generally carry the most weight: (1) the degree of culpability of the party who lost or destroyed the evidence; and (2) the degree of actual prejudice to the other party.”  . . . </p>

<p id="c0cbc423-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also readily concludes that the recording of the June 3, 2013 conversation was relevant to numerous disputed facts and issues in this case. For instance, to prevail on his tortious interference claims, Plaintiff must prove that Defendants’ communication with KYGO was improper, and that Defendants’ conduct caused <span title="513" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-513">p. 513</span>KYGO to terminate him. The statements made by Plaintiff and by Messrs. Call and Haskell the day following the incident with Swift and the day before KYGO fired him would plainly be relevant to proving or disproving those facts. Moreover, the record reflects that one of the reasons Mr. Call decided to terminate Plaintiff was because he perceived that Plaintiff had “changed his story” during the course of his communications with KYGO. A recording of this conversation could be invaluable to a jury that will be asked to decide, in part, whether they agree with Mr. Call’s assessment that Plaintiff has been inconsistent in his descriptions of the events of June 2, 2013. . . . </p>

<p id="c0cbc425-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court similarly finds that Defendants were prejudiced by the loss of evidence. At the very least, if the complete recording had been available, it might have saved time and expense in litigation by documenting the June 3, 2013 conversation, allowing for better preparation for depositions and ultimately for trial. Moreover, to the extent there may now be discrepancies in the accounts that Plaintiff and Messrs. Call and Haskill give regarding their June 3, 2013 conversation, the recording would probably have resolved them. . . . </p>

<p id="c0cbc427-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Court finds that the degree of culpability warrants a sanction. Although the Court declines to make a finding that Plaintiff acted in “bad faith” in the sense that he <i>intended</i> to destroy the evidence, it also cannot characterize the loss or destruction of evidence in this case as innocent, or as “<i>mere</i> negligence.” Rather, the spoliation falls higher up on the “continuum of fault.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0cbc428-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff knew full well that litigation was imminent, since he was pursuing it. He knew that he was the only person in possession of the complete audio recording. He made the decision—inexplicably, in the Court’s view—to <i>alter</i> the original evidence and to present his lawyer with only “clips” hand-picked from the underlying evidence. This reflects that he obviously intended to make use of portions of the recording to advance his own claims. . . . Plaintiff could and should have made sure that <i>some</i> means of backing up the files relevant to litigation was in place, but this was not done.</p>
<p id="c0cbc429-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, when Plaintiff surrendered his laptop for repair or replacement, he knew that it contained relevant evidence. Depending on whether this occurred before or after the loss of his external hard drive (the record is unclear), the laptop contained either the only remaining copy of the complete audio file or one of only two, as Plaintiff also knew or should have known. Despite this, the record does not reflect that he made any effort to retain the hard drive, to have it returned to him after he surrendered the damaged laptop, or to otherwise recover the lost file(s). The same was true when his external hard drive stopped working. Rather than saving it, seeking to have it repaired, or taking steps to preserve the files stored on it, Plaintiff evidently just set the drive aside, and eventually lost it. . . . </p>

<p id="c0cbc42b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the discussion of Plaintiff’s culpability above, the Court rejects Defendants’ request to make a finding of bad faith and to give the jury an adverse inference instruction. Having considered various options, and after directing Defendants to <span title="514" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-514">p. 514</span>brief the issue of alternative sanctions, the Court finds that the following sanction is appropriate: <i>Notwithstanding any limitations under Federal Rule of Evidence 611(b), Defendants will be permitted to cross-examine Plaintiff in front of the jury regarding the record of his spoliation of evidence, as described above</i>.</p>
<p id="c0cbc42c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court concludes this is the most appropriate sanction for several reasons. <i>First</i>, while Plaintiff is culpable, the Court does not find that the nature of that culpability warrants an adverse inference instruction. Although a threshold finding of bad faith is a prerequisite for an adverse inference, the Court does not view bad faith as a binary or “yes/no” issue. . . . [T]he record does not establish—at least not clearly—that Plaintiff was acting with an <i>intent</i> to deprive Defendants of relevant evidence. Absent a more clear showing that Plaintiff’s conduct reflected his own “consciousness of a weak case,” an adverse inference instruction is not appropriate. [Citing case]; <i>see also</i> Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(2) (as to electronically stored information, adverse inference jury instruction is permissible “only upon [a] finding that the party acted with the intent to deprive another party of the information’s use in litigation.”). . . . </p>
<p id="c0cbc42d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A]llowing Defendants to cross examine Plaintiff about his spoliation of evidence has the benefit of allowing the jury to make its own assessment of Plaintiff’s degree of culpability and of the actual prejudice to Defendants. The Court has little doubt that if the jury concludes Plaintiff acted with bad faith or an intention to destroy or conceal evidence, they will draw their own adverse inferences, whether the Court instructs it or not. In this case where Plaintiff’s credibility is critical to his claims, allowing cross-examination regarding his spoliation of evidence, including the fact that he personally chose and edited the “clips” now available to the jury is therefore quite a heavy sanction. On the other hand, if the jury is persuaded that Plaintiff’s actions were indeed innocent, then the impact of the Court’s sanction will be far less harsh. . . . </p>
<p id="c0cbc42e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he remedial and punitive impact of the Court’s sanction will follow from the jury’s own findings and credibility determinations, rather than from findings by the Court on the basis of only the written record. . . . </p>
<p id="c0cbc42f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For all these reasons, the Court concludes in the exercise of its discretion that among all the many possible sanctions it might impose, the one set forth above is properly suited to the circumstances of this case, is no more onerous than is necessary to serve its purposes, and best serves the interests of justice.</p>

</ol></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0cbeb4a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the court implies that an adverse inference instruction is the most extreme form of sanction for spoliation, that’s not quite accurate. In some cases courts have either dismissed the complaint (the ultimate sanction for a plaintiff) or ordered judgment for the plaintiff (the corresponding sanction for a defendant). However you answered the question in the preceding note, can you articulate an argument that such a sanction (dismissal) would have been too extreme on the facts of this case?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0cbeb4b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider the behavior of the plaintiff’s lawyer. In a footnote edited from the opinion reproduced here, Judge Martínez tersely noted, “The Court takes an even more dim view of Plaintiff’s counsel’s unexplained failure to obtain, listen to, preserve, and produce the complete audio file, but that is a separate issue from whether Plaintiff should be sanctioned.” In <i>Zubulake</i>, with which the chapter began, Judge Scheindlin had a good deal more to say about lawyers’ continuing obligation to assure that digital evidence be preserved. In the next case, which does not involve e-discovery, the judge focuses on a lawyer’s excessive gamesmanship during discovery and crafts a unique sanction to address this behavior.</p></li>

<p id="c0cbeb51-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Something is rotten, but contrary to Marcellus’s suggestion to Horatio, it’s not in Denmark. Rather, it’s in discovery in modern federal civil litigation right here in the United States. . . . </p>
<p id="c0cbeb52-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Discovery—a process intended to facilitate the free flow of information between parties—is now too often mired in obstructionism. Today’s “litigators” are quick to <span title="516" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-516">p. 516</span>dispute discovery requests, slow to produce information, and all-too-eager to object at every stage of the process. They often object using boilerplate language containing every objection imaginable, despite the fact that courts have resoundingly disapproved of such boilerplate objections. Some litigators do this to grandstand for their client, to intentionally obstruct the flow of clearly discoverable information, to try and win a war of attrition, or to intimidate and harass the opposing party. Others do it simply because it’s how they were taught. . . . Whatever the reason, obstructionist discovery conduct is born of a warped view of zealous advocacy, often formed by insecurities and fear of the truth. This conduct fuels the astronomically costly litigation industry at the expense of “the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 1. It persists because most litigators and a few real trial lawyers—even very good ones, like the lawyers in this case—have come to accept it as part of the routine chicanery of federal discovery practice.</p>
<p id="c0cbeb53-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the litigators and trial lawyers do not deserve all the blame for obstructionist discovery conduct because judges so often ignore this conduct, and by doing so we reinforce—even <i>incentivize</i>—obstructionist tactics. . . . Unless judges impose serious adverse consequences, like court-imposed sanctions, litigators’ conditional reflexes will persist. The point of court-imposed sanctions is to stop reinforcing winning through obstruction.</p>
<p id="c0cbeb54-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While obstructionist tactics pervade all aspects of pretrial discovery, this case involves discovery abuse perpetrated during depositions. Earlier this year, in preparation for a hard-fought product liability jury trial, I was called upon by the parties to rule on numerous objections to deposition transcripts that the parties intended to use at trial. I noticed that the deposition transcripts were littered with what I perceived to be meritless objections made by one of the defendant’s lawyers, whom I refer to here as “Counsel.” I was shocked by what I read. Thus, for the reasons discussed below, I find that Counsel’s deposition conduct warrants sanctions. . . . </p>
<p id="c0cbeb55-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The court describes “hundreds of unnecessary objections and interruptions” by Counsel during depositions, most of which “completely lacked merit and often ended up influencing how the witnesses responded to questions."]</p>
<p id="c0cbeb56-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on Counsel’s deposition conduct, I would be well within my discretion to impose substantial monetary sanctions on Counsel. But I am less interested in negatively affecting Counsel’s pocketbook than I am in positively affecting Counsel’s obstructive deposition practices. I am also interested in deterring others who might be inclined to comport themselves similarly to Counsel. . . . Deterrence is especially important given that so many litigators are <i>trained</i> to make obstructionist objections. For instance, at trial, when I challenged Counsel’s use of “form” objections, Counsel responded, “Well, I’m sorry, Your Honor, but that was my training. . . . ” While monetary sanctions are certainly warranted for Counsel’s witness coaching and excessive interruptions, a more outside-the-box sanction may better serve the goal of changing improper tactics that modern litigators are trained to use. <i>See</i> Matthew L. Jarvey, Note, <i>Boilerplate Discovery Objections: How They Are Used, Why They Are Wrong, and What We Can Do About Them,</i> 61 Drake L. Rev. 913, 931-36 (2013) (discussing the importance of unorthodox sanctions in deterring discovery abuse).</p>
<p id="c0cbeb57-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of this goal, I impose the following sanction: Counsel must write and produce a training video in which Counsel, or another partner in Counsel’s firm, <span title="517" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-517">p. 517</span>appears and explains the holding and rationale of this opinion, and provides specific steps lawyers must take to comply with its rationale in future depositions in any federal and state court. . . . The lawyer in the video must state that the video is being produced and distributed pursuant to a federal court’s sanction order regarding a partner in the firm, but the lawyer need not state the name of the partner, the case the sanctions arose under, or the court issuing this order. Upon completing the video, Counsel must file it with this court, under seal, for my review and approval. If and when I approve the video, Counsel must (1) notify certain lawyers at Counsel’s firm about the video via e-mail and (2) provide those lawyers with access to the video. The lawyers who must receive this notice and access include each lawyer at Counsel’s firm—including its branch offices worldwide—who engages in federal or state litigation or who works in any practice group in which at least two of the lawyers have filed an appearance in any state or federal case in the United States. After providing these lawyers with notice of and access to the video, Counsel must file in this court, under seal, (1) an affidavit certifying that Counsel complied with this order and received no assistance (other than technical help or help from the lawyer appearing in the video) in creating the video’s content and (2) a copy of the e-mail notifying the appropriate lawyers in Counsel’s firm about the video. . . . Failure to comply with this order within 90 days may result in additional sanctions. . . . </p>
<p id="c0cbeb58-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Depositions can be stressful and contentious, and lawyers are bound to make the occasional improper objection. But Counsel’s improper objections, coaching, and interruptions went far beyond what judges should tolerate of any lawyer, let alone one as experienced and skilled as Counsel. . . . For the reasons stated in this opinion, I find that sanctions are appropriate in response to Counsel’s improper deposition conduct, which impeded, delayed, and frustrated the fair examination of witnesses in the depositions related to this case that Counsel defended. I therefore impose the sanction described above.</p>

<p id="c0cc1273-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having looked at some of the obstacles to the smooth functioning of discovery, step back and consider its place in the larger scheme. The Supreme Court’s recent glosses on Rule 8 (in <i>Twombly</i> and <i>Iqbal</i>) will prevent some cases from reaching discovery. For those that do, discovery will unearth information the parties need for trial—even as that same discovery may reduce the likelihood that trial will occur. The next two chapters illuminate this paradox. Chapter 8 looks at formal and informal ways in which parties may avoid trial. Chapter 9 looks at what happens during trial itself.</p>
<p id="c0cc1274-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The paradoxical consequences of discovery flow from its dual role. It aims to prevent surprise at trial and to assure that cases will be resolved justly on their merits. Surprise witnesses make good courtroom drama but do not reassure us that justice has been done. To avoid such surprises at trial, discovery aims at laying bare both the parties’ positions and the facts of the case.</p>
<p id="c0cc1275-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its other guise, discovery aims to put the parties in a position from which they can realistically assess the merits. In an ideal world, such assessments would match (that is, the parties would all accurately predict the results of a trial). When that happens, the parties will often settle. The next chapter explores the dynamics of settlement. When the parties’ assessments of the merits are mismatched, settlement is unlikely, but other mechanisms, like summary judgment, may use the products of discovery to end the case.</p>
<p id="c0cc1276-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Still other parties may be so averse to the litigation process—including discovery—that they try to take themselves outside the adjudicatory system.

<p id="c0cc60c1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q1.</b> B is the correct response; see Rule 26(d)(1). A is incorrect; although the parties must early on disclose the identity of experts they plan to use (Rule 26(a)(2)), the exchange of reports typically comes quite late in the process (see Rule 26(a)(2)(D)(i)). C and D are wrong because Rule 26(d)(1) forbids depositions or interrogatories before the parties’ planning conference. E is wrong because, although these initial disclosures will be among the first required exchanges of information, they do not come until 14 days <i>after</i> the planning conference (Rule 26(a)(1)(C)).</p>
<p id="c0cc60c2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q2.</b> B, C, D, and E are correct responses. B is correct (and A is incorrect) because at the initial disclosure stage a party need disclose only information <i>supporting</i> her claim or defense. C is correct because such a letter would be information protected by the attorney-client privilege and thus undiscoverable unless the privilege were waived. Note, though, that in response to such a request Barbara would have to comply with Rule 26(b)(5), explaining what the document was and why she was claiming privilege. D is correct because the discovery rules do not prohibit informal information gathering. E is correct because, if we assume the employee has relevant, unprivileged information, he can be deposed.</p>
<p id="c0cc60c3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q3.</b> A is likely the best response. B is wrong because <i>if</i> the other contracts were relevant (doubtful but possible), the fact that their terms would embarrass Barbara would not protect them from discovery. C is wrong because the contracts were drafted in the ordinary course of business, not with litigation in mind. D is wrong because while the contracts may be the product of some confidential communications, only those communications themselves are protected by the privilege—the contracts themselves are not protected.</p>
<p id="c0cc60c4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4.</b> B is the only correct response. Rule 30(d)(3) permits such a recess, and under the circumstances it seems very likely that the court would issue a protective order. A is wrong because Rule 30(c)(2) provides that for any objection except on grounds of privilege, the question must be answered but the “testimony is taken subject to any objection.” C is wrong because Rule 30(c)(2) provides that a person “may instruct a deponent not to answer <span title="522" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-522">p. 522</span>only when necessary to protect a privilege, enforce [a court-ordered limitation on discovery] or to present a motion under Rule 30(d)(3).” D is wrong because what it means to take testimony “subject to any objection” (Rule 30(c)(2)) is precisely that the objection is preserved and may be renewed if Donald tries to use Ethan’s answer in any later stage, say in a motion for summary judgment or during cross-examination at trial; at that point the judge will rule on the objection and exclude the evidence if, as in this case, it is irrelevant.</p>
<p id="c0cc60c5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q5.</b> C and D are the correct responses. A and B are wrong because their provisions apply only to experts “retained in anticipation of litigation.” As a CPA, this witness is certainly an expert, but he was hired to run Barbara’s company finances, not specially to testify in this case. Thus, though an expert, he is not an expert hired in anticipation of litigation and thus not subject to the provisions of Rule 26(b)(4). Therefore no report (so A is wrong) and no immunity from deposition (so B is wrong). C is correct because as a witness in possession of relevant unprivileged information he can be deposed. D is correct because the Rule 26(a)(2)(B) report applies only to experts retained in anticipation of litigation.</p>
<p id="c0cc60c6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q6.</b> C and D are the correct responses. A is wrong because the duty to preserve evidence (enforced through the common law doctrine of spoliation) attaches whenever one is aware (or should be aware) that litigation is reasonably likely. B is wrong because Rule 37(c) states that a court need not sanction a party for failing to disclose a document required by Rule 26(a) if the error is harmless. Here, Barbara has received the document while discovery is still underway and is, therefore, unlikely to be harmed by the earlier failure to disclose. C is correct because Rule 37(d)(3) specifically so provides. D is correct because Barbara needs a specific court order (which is then disobeyed) before one can seek sanctions (Rule 37(a) and (b)).</p>
