<p id="c0ff302a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This section combines the approaches taken in the two sections that precede it. Part I took a top-down view, looking at the ways in which the U.S. Constitution establishes constraints for civil litigation. Part II started at the bottom, taking the individual lawsuit as its unit of examination.</p>
<p id="c0ff302b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn now to opportunities and problems that arise when procedural rules expand the confines of a lawsuit. Our forum for that examination is the rules of joinder, the principles that allow parties to modern civil litigation to combine claims and add additional parties. Those principles constitute one of the respects in which contemporary civil litigation differs sharply from its predecessors: A modern lawsuit can, to a large extent, aim at resolving an entire dispute by encompassing all the claims and all the parties involved.</p>
<p id="c0ff302c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those same principles, however, challenge both the jurisdictional scheme elaborated in Part I and the litigation process explored in Part II. In many cases jurisdictional problems will either limit or defeat joinder that would otherwise be available. From one standpoint, these limitations are undesirable restrictions on a lawsuit that would otherwise provide a comprehensive resolution to a dispute. From another <span title="776" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-776">p. 776</span>standpoint, jurisdictional limits prevent what might otherwise become a monster from devouring both the court system and the litigants swept into it. Joinder poses a similar issue for the design of the procedural system. Flexible joinder rules permit parties to frame issues broadly and to include everyone who has a stake in the resolution of those issues. Carried to its logical conclusion, however, this principle of inclusion can create a lawsuit that cannot resolve anything—because it is unmanageable. The Rules consequently walk a fine line, seeking broad inclusion but trying to keep inclusiveness from preventing resolution of the dispute.</p>
<p id="c0ff302d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issues thus raised provide a review of much of this course. At the threshold of many cases will be both a pleading problem and a jurisdictional problem. The pleading problem will require you to consider whether the party or claim fits within the joinder rule’s definition. If it does, there will sometimes be a second level of inquiry: Assuming that the party or claim can be joined as a matter of pleading, does the court’s jurisdictional reach extend far enough to allow joinder of this claim or this party? Just beyond the pleading and jurisdictional inquiries may lie a question about claim or issue preclusion—one party seeking to achieve it, another to avoid it by manipulating joinder rules. This interplay among principles already explored makes joinder challenging—and useful as a test of your grasp of the preceding material.</p>
