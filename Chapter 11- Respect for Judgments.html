<div class="cc-section epub-section epub-anyhead" id="c0f3228a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">
<p id="c0f3228b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Procedural rules serve two masters. They aim to air disputes completely and to reach an accurate and just outcome. They also seek to end disputes—even if the resting condition is less than optimal. Writers sometimes loftily describe this second goal as “finality” or “repose.” Several branches of law serve the goal of finality. Statutes of limitations bar litigation that begins too late. Precedent limits dispute about governing legal principles. And appellate courts have only limited power to overturn trial court findings. This chapter focuses on two other common law doctrines that serve to bring lawsuits to an end: <i>claim preclusion</i> and <i>issue preclusion</i>.</p>
<p id="c0f3228c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both doctrines form part of the broader topic of <i>former adjudication</i>—the effect of judgments on subsequent litigation. These doctrines answer a pair of related questions: What does it mean for a lawsuit to be over? What does a concluded lawsuit decide? Suppose, for instance, that Pamela sues Donald for injuries sustained in an auto accident, and the case goes to a final judgment. The loser can, of course, appeal. But can there be a second lawsuit? For example, may Pamela bring a second suit concerning the same accident, this time seeking recovery for damage to her automobile? Today most courts would say no, based on claim preclusion. See, for example, <i>Ison v. Thomas</i>, in Chapter 1 (supra page 48). Claim preclusion forbids a party from litigating a claim that was, or could and should have been, raised in former litigation.</p>
<p id="c0f3228d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Issue preclusion comes into play when a claim is not barred from subsequent litigation, but some issue involved in that claim was actually previously litigated. Suppose Pamela and Donald had the misfortune to become involved in a second collision the week after the first. Pamela’s suit against Donald for injuries sustained <span title="704" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-704">p. 704</span>in the first accident would not prevent her from bringing suit concerning the second one. But she and Donald might find themselves prevented from relitigating issues decided in that first suit that are relevant to the second, such as whether at the time of the accidents either was required to wear glasses while driving.</p>
<p id="c0f3228e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much of this chapter will be devoted to exploring the conditions that enable a party to invoke issue or claim preclusion. You will find that in examining these questions courts sometimes use an older set of terminology to refer to these concepts. They refer to claim preclusion as <i>res judicata</i> and to issue preclusion as <i>collateral estoppel</i>. They also occasionally use <i>res judicata</i> to refer to the entire topic of former adjudication. The underlying ideas are identical; only the terminology varies.</p>

<p id="c0f32291-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Claim preclusion—barring an entire second action—occurs when the case concerns the same claim as a prior action, is litigated by the same parties to the prior action, and when the first action resulted in a final judgment on the merits. In this section, we will consider the meaning of each of these phrases: “same claim,” “same parties,” “final judgment,” and “judgment on the merits.” As we do, we will explore the underlying goals of claim preclusion: efficiency, finality, and the avoidance of inconsistency.</p>
<div id="c0f32292-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0f32293-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">1.&nbsp;Precluding the “Same” Claim</p></h3></div>

<p id="c0f32294-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The standard doctrinal formulation says that claim preclusion bars the same claim from relitigation. Thus stated, the principle sounds both uncontroversial and obvious. In practice, matters become much more interesting because claim preclusion has two goals—the fostering of efficiency and the prevention of inconsistency. In pursuit of these goals, claim preclusion goes much further than that simple statement might suggest.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="c0f32295-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">

<p id="c0f32297-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Claim preclusion grows from pleading. A common law pleader could not combine different writs in a single suit. Because it seemed unfair to block a second suit if the pleader’s only mistake lay in selecting the wrong writ, common law courts precluded a plaintiff only from bringing a second claim on the same writ; the plaintiff remained free to try a different writ on the same facts.</p>
<p id="c0f32298-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The two great pleading reforms of the past 150 years, the Field Codes in the nineteenth century and the Rules in the twentieth, freed pleaders from the confines of the writs. But to the extent they thereby made pleading easier, they made claim preclusion broader. A pleader under the Codes or the Rules was free to combine claims resting on different legal theories and different facts. Did she <span title="705" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-705">p. 705</span>therefore <i>have</i> to do so at the risk of finding them precluded? To put the problem at its most extreme, under Rules 8 and 18, a pleader may state as many claims as she has against the opposing party. If she brings only one such claim, are all others forever precluded? No court has ever gone this far, but, short of this extreme, how broadly should preclusion sweep? In the next case the court contrasts two answers to that question.</p>

<p id="c0f349ae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The City of Vandalia is fairly small (the population is less than 2,500), and apparently its police have maintained informal ways. When Charles Frier parked one of his cars in a narrow street, which forced others to drive on someone else’s lawn to get around Frier’s car, the police left two notes at Frier’s house asking him to move the car. That did not work, so an officer called a local garage, which towed the car back to the garage. The officer left a note, addressed to “Charlie,” telling him where he could find the car. The officer did not issue a citation for illegal parking, however; he later testified that he wanted to make it easier for Frier to retrieve the car.</p>
<p id="c0f349af-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Frier balked at paying the $10 fee the garage wanted. He also balked at keeping his cars out of the street. The police had garages tow four of them in 1983—a 1963 Ford Falcon, a 1970 Plymouth Duster, a 1971 Opal GT, and a 1971 Dodge van. Instead of paying the garages, Frier filed suits in the courts of Illinois seeking replevin. Each suit named as defendants the City of Vandalia and the garage that had towed the car.</p>
<p id="c0f349b0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the suits (which sought to replevy two cars) was dismissed voluntarily when Frier got his cars back. We do not know whether he paid for the tows and the subsequent daily storage fees or whether the garage thought it cheaper to surrender the cars than to defend the suit. The other two cases were consolidated and litigated. The police testified to the circumstances under which they had called for the tows. The court concluded that the police properly took the cars into the City’s possession to remove obstructions to the alley, and it declined to issue the writ of replevin because the City had the right to remove the cars from the street. Frier then retrieved another car;<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100A3_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N100A3_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span> so far as we can tell, a garage still has the 1970 Plymouth Duster.</p>
<p id="c0f349b2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After losing in state court, Frier turned to federal court. His [federal] complaint maintained that the City had not offered him a hearing either before or after it took the cars and that it is the “official policy” of the City not to do so. The complaint invoked the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. §1983, and it sought equitable relief in addition to $100,000 in compensatory and $100,000 in punitive damages. The district court, after reviewing the transcript of the replevin action, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. (Because the judge considered the transcript he should have treated the <span title="706" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-706">p. 706</span>motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment. We analyze the decision as if he had done so.) The court found that Frier had notice of each tow and knew how to get his cars back. Frier also had a full hearing in the replevin action on the propriety of the tows. Although the judicial hearing came approximately one month after the tows, the court thought the delay permissible.</p>
<p id="c0f349b3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A month is a long wait for a hearing when the subject is an automobile. The automobile is “property” within the meaning of the Due Process Clause, and the City therefore must furnish appropriate process. Sutton v. City of Milwaukee, 672 F.2d 644 (7th Cir. 1982), holds that a hearing is not necessary before the police tow a car but suggests that one must be furnished promptly after the tow. <i>Sutton</i> also suggests, in line with many other cases, that the City must establish the process and tender an opportunity for a hearing; it may not sit back and wait for the aggrieved person to file a suit.</p>
<p id="c0f349b4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The City, for its part, maintains that a few isolated tows without hearings are not the “policy” of the City and may not be imputed to it, and that anyway a month’s delay in holding a hearing about seized property is permissible. . . . </p>
<p id="c0f349b5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court ought not resolve a constitution[al] dispute unless that is absolutely necessary. Here it is not. Frier had his day in court in the replevin action. The City has argued that this precludes further suits. (The City raised this argument in the motion to dismiss, which is irregular but not fatally so. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c).) The district court bypassed this argument because, it believed, Frier could not have asserted his constitutional arguments in a replevin action. This is only partially correct.</p>
<p id="c0f349b6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Frier could not have obtained punitive damages or declaratory relief in a suit limited to replevin. But he was free to join one count seeking such relief with another seeking replevin. See Welch v. Brunswick Corp., 10 Ill. App. 3d 693 (1st Dist. 1973), revd. in part on other grounds, 57 Ill. 2d 461 (1974); Hanaman v. Davis, 20 Ill. App. 2d 111 (2d Dist. 1959), both of which allow one count seeking replevin to be joined with another count seeking different relief. As we show below, the law of Illinois, which under 28 U.S.C. §1738 governs the preclusive effect to be given to the judgment in the replevin actions, see Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373 (1985), would bar this suit. The City therefore is entitled to prevail on the ground of claim preclusion, although the district court did not decide the case on that ground. See Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Ludwig, 426 U.S. 479 (1976).</p>
<p id="c0f349b7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Illinois recognizes the principles of claim preclusion (also called <i>res judicata</i> or estoppel by judgment). Jones v. City of Alton, 757 F.2d 878, 884-85 (7th Cir. 1985) (summarizing the law of preclusion in Illinois). One suit precludes a second “where the parties and the cause of action are identical.” “Causes of action are identical where the evidence necessary to sustain a second verdict would sustain the first, i.e., where the causes of action are based upon a common core of operative facts.” Two suits may entail the same “cause of action” even though they present different legal theories, and the first suit “operates as an absolute bar to a subsequent action. . . . ‘not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose.’”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0f349b8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="707" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-707">p. 707</span>The City was a defendant in each replevin action. Frier could have urged constitutional grounds as reasons for replevin.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100D2_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N100D2_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">2</a></span> He also could have joined a constitutional claim seeking punitive damages and declaratory relief to his demand for replevin, and therefore he had a full and fair opportunity to litigate (unlike <i>Jones v. City of Alton</i>, where procedural obstacles impeded litigation of the federal claim). The actions also involve both the same “common core of operative facts” and the same transactions. Frier argues that the City towed his cars wrongfully. Each complaint seeking replevin asserted [that] Frier owned each car and that it had not been “seized under lawful process”—in other words, that there had been no citation and no hearing at which anyone had found that the cars were illegally parked. The replevin statute requires a plaintiff to show that the property was taken without “lawful process.” Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 110, §19-104. “Process,” even in its technical sense, initiates or follows a hearing. Had there been process and a hearing at which a magistrate found the cars to have been illegally parked, Frier would have had no claim for replevin no matter how strongly he contested the substantive issue. The “operative facts” in the replevin and §1983 actions therefore are the same. Frier urges that he owned the car (the property interest) and that the City did not offer him a hearing to adjudicate the legality of his parking (the absence of due process).</p>
<p id="c0f349ba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The replevin actions diverged from the path of this §1983 suit only because the state judge adjudicated on the merits the propriety of the seizures. Having found the seizures proper, the judge had no occasion to determine whether the City should have offered Frier an earlier hearing. But this divergence does not mean that the two legal theories require a different “core of operative facts.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0f349bb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To the extent there is any doubt about this, we look. . . . to the purpose of doctrines of preclusion. Claim preclusion is designed to impel “parties to consolidate all closely related matters into one suit.” This prevents the oppression of defendants by multiple cases, which may be easy to file and costly to defend. There is no assurance that a second or third case will be decided more accurately than the first and so there is no good reason to incur the costs of litigation more than once. When the facts and issues of all theories of liability are closely related, one case is enough. Here the replevin theory contained the elements that make up a due process theory, and we are therefore confident that the courts of Illinois would treat both theories as one “cause of action.” The final question is whether it makes a difference that only two of the replevin actions went to judgment, while here Frier challenges the towing of four cars. Under Illinois law the answer is no. The defendant may invoke claim preclusion when the plaintiff litigated in the first suit a subset of all available disputes between the parties. See Baird &amp; Warner, Inc. v. Addison Industrial Park, Inc., 70 Ill. App. 3d 59 (1st Dist. 1979), which holds that a suit on three of six disputed parcels of land precludes a subsequent suit on all six. We doubt that Illinois would see difference between three lots out of six and two cars out of four.</p>

<p id="c0f370cf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, the majority has simply applied the wrong analysis to the problem at hand. Rather than trying to squeeze a <i>res judicata</i> solution into a mold that does not fit, I would review the facts to determine whether Frier’s procedural due process claims could withstand a summary judgment motion. Because I believe the City was entitled to summary judgment, I concur in the result.</p>

<p id="c0f370d1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining whether the disposition of a claim in State court precludes a subsequent suit on the same claim in federal court, the federal court must apply the State’s law of <i>res judicata</i>. Because Illinois continues to adhere to the narrow, traditional view of claim preclusion, as opposed to the broader approach codified in the Restatement (Second) of Judgments §§24, 25 (1982), I would hold that Frier’s substantive traffic law claim does not preclude this subsequent procedural due process claim. Under the more modern view of the new Restatement, all claims arising from a single “transaction”—broadly defined to include matters related in time, space, origin, and motivation—must be litigated in a single, initial lawsuit, or be barred from being raised in subsequent litigation. There was only one transaction in the case at bar: the seizure of Frier’s cars. Accordingly, Frier should have raised both his substantive and procedural objections to the seizure in one initial lawsuit.</p>
<p id="c0f370d2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Illinois, however, has not adopted the view of the new Restatement.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1010F_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1010F_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span> Rather, as the majority recognizes, the Illinois courts focus on the similarities between the causes of action alleged in both suits, not on whether there is a common factual transaction. One suit precludes a second “where the parties and the cause of action are identical.” Redfern v. Sullivan, 111 Ill. App. 3d 372, 444 N.E.2d 205, 208 (1983). “Causes of action are identical where the evidence necessary to sustain a second verdict would sustain the first, i.e., where the causes of action are based upon a common core of operative facts.” Id. . . . </p>
<p id="c0f370d4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, the common set of facts that must be shown to invoke Illinois’ doctrine of claim preclusion is defined as those facts necessary to sustain the cause of action, not as those facts that could be conveniently litigated in one lawsuit. This focus on the elements of the causes of action and the proofs at trial—rather than on the policy advantages of trying both actions in one suit—dooms any attempt to invoke claim preclusion in the case at bar. To be sure, both actions arise from the same seizure of the same cars. Yet, both the theory of recovery and focus of factual inquiry are dramatically different in each case. Frier’s replevin claim was substantive in nature; to replevy property, the claimant must show his superior possessory rights. Frier’s <span title="709" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-709">p. 709</span>possessory rights turned on the legality of his parking. Because the trial court found that “the officer reasonably believed and had a right to believe that. . . . [Frier’s] vehicle obstructed the free use and passage way of that street at that time,” it concluded that, therefore, Frier did not enjoy the “superior right to possession of the property” necessary to sustain a replevin action.</p>
<p id="c0f370d5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Frier’s procedural due process claim requires an entirely different factual showing. The legality or reasonableness of the seizure is irrelevant. Because of the “risk of error inherent in the truth-finding process,” an individual is entitled to certain procedural safeguards regardless of whether the deprivation of property was substantively justified. The focus of the inquiry, then, is the adequacy of procedures attending the seizure, not the seizure itself.</p>
<p id="c0f370d6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority urges that Frier could have joined a separate constitutional claim to his replevin action. This precise argument was rejected in <i>Fountas</i>, 455 N.E.2d at 204. . . . Illinois law focuses on the similarities and differences between the various causes of action. That two wholly different causes of action arising out of the same transaction could be joined together as one convenient trial unit is irrelevant for the purposes of Illinois law, though this would be dispositive under the new Restatement.</p>

<p id="c0f370d8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It was established at Frier’s replevin trial that the City police caused various service station owners to tow four of Frier’s cars and, in lieu of a traffic citation, left written notice of the reason for the towing and the whereabouts of the cars. Frier eventually recovered two of his cars. Thus, the replevin action, and this action, concern only two of the cars. Frier could have recovered one of those cars immediately by paying a $10.00 towing fee to the owner of the service station that towed the car. However, Frier was informed that any further delay in reclaiming the car would result in a $2.50 per day storage charge. Frier was free to reclaim the other car without paying any fee. I would hold that, on the basis of these uncontested facts, the City was entitled to summary judgment against Frier’s procedural due process claim. . . . </p>

This holding would not necessarily conflict with recent decisions of other courts requiring more immediate and elaborate postdeprivation process. More elaborate process may well be required in those cases because the towing practices of the various municipalities were more burdensome on the respective petitioners: Immediate reclamation required significantly more than $10.00 and the litigants had standing to represent indigents who could afford no fee. We need not reach such troublesome issues in the case at bar.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0f3be0b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a case decided 13 years after <i>Frier</i>, the Illinois Supreme Court clarified that the transactional test should apply. River Park, Inc. v. City of Highland Park, 184 Ill. 2d 290 (1998). The court observed that Illinois courts had for years used both the “transactional” and “same evidence” tests, which “resulted in <span title="711" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-711">p. 711</span>courts having to engage in lengthy analyses of claims under both tests” and “created confusion as to the proper application of these tests.” Id. at 310.

<li class=""><p id="c0f3be0d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice that the doctrines of claim preclusion discussed in <i>Frier</i> do not flow from the Constitution, Rules, or statute but from common law. One could imagine an amendment to Rule 8 stating that a final judgment on a claim barred the refiling of that claim or any other arising from the same transaction or occurrence.

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0f3be0f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Claim preclusion is designed to impel “parties to consolidate all closely related matters into one suit[.]” This prevents the oppression of defendants by multiple cases, which may be easy to file and costly to defend. There is no assurance that a second or third case will be decided more accurately than the first and so there is no good reason to incur the costs of litigation more than once.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0f3be10-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Would any of these principles be violated by permitting Frier to bring a second case asserting his constitutional challenge to Vandalia’s towing practices?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0f3be12-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 8(c) lists claim preclusion (which the Rule calls <i>res judicata</i>) as an affirmative defense: Failure to plead and prove an affirmative defense results in waiving it.

<li class=""><p id="c0f3be13-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the concern is fairness to the opposing party, why can’t a litigant avoid preclusion by paying all the expenses of the first lawsuit? The law contains no such exception.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0f3be14-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many states and the federal court system use the transactional definition of “claim” for preclusion purposes. Both <i>Frier</i> opinions agree that, under the transactional test, Frier’s second claim would have been precluded. Is this a sensible result? Assuming that plaintiff wants to challenge the city’s entire procedure for towing cars, should he have had to do so when he tried to retrieve his car from the garage? Would it make more sense to permit him to get his car back and then bring a second, broad-based constitutional challenge to the underlying process?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0f3be15-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The standard answer to the questions posed in the preceding note is that forcing a plaintiff to put into his complaint all the claims arising out of a transaction does not mean the court will try all those claims in a single suit. Rule 42(b) <span title="712" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-712">p. 712</span>(and equivalent state rules) give trial courts authority to sever claims for trial. One can imagine a court would wish to separate Frier’s claim seeking his car back from the claim that the city’s towing process was unconstitutional. If that is so, however, it casts some doubt on whether the two claims should be treated as one for preclusion purposes. Notice that Restatement (Second) of Judgments §24(b) specifies that “whether [the claims] form a convenient trial unit” is one of the factors to be considered in deciding whether to preclude them.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0f3be16-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having grasped the counterintuitive idea that unlitigated claims can be precluded, do not overstate the principle.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0f3e527-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before a claim can be precluded from being raised, it must have <i>been</i> a claim at the time of the first suit. For example, if after the <i>Frier</i> litigation ended Vandalia again towed one of Frier’s vehicles, new due process and replevin claims would arise, ones not barred by claim preclusion.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0f3e528-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A similar principle prevents claim preclusion from applying if the court rendering the first judgment lacked jurisdiction over the allegedly precluded claim. For example, suppose Frier appeared in traffic court to contest his cars being towed. That court could not have awarded him damages sought for his constitutional claim, so <i>res judicata</i> would not bar that claim.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0f3e529-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor does the transactional definition extend to claims arising from the same episode but belonging to different parties. For example, if Husband and Wife were injured when their car was hit by <i>T</i>’s truck, each can sue <i>T</i>, so a suit by Wife will not preclude a later suit by Husband. While a compulsory joinder of parties rule might be desirable in certain cases, in Reid v. Spadone Machine Co., 119 N.H. 198 (1979), the court, noting that no such compulsory joinder rule exists, allowed a wife to sue for loss of consortium after her husband had won a claim for an employment-related injury. For another example, see <i>Illinois Central Gulf R. v. Parks</i>, infra page 738.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0f3e52b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the <i>Frier</i> court, the question was whether the courts of Illinois, which rendered the first judgment, would bar the civil rights claim. That is almost always the right analysis. So if Frier had first brought his civil rights claim in federal court, then brought a state law replevin action, the Illinois state court would have faced the question of what preclusive effect a federal court would assign to its judgment in the first case. (As a quick review of this chapter so far, explain what the answer to that question is. Hint: Note 5, supra, provides key information.)</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0f3e52c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose, however, the first case is brought in a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction. Such a court is bound by the holding in <i>Erie Railroad v. Tompkins</i> (see Chapter 4), to apply the substantive law of the state where it sits.

<p id="c0f40c50-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And even apart from the purely default character of Rule 41(b), it would be peculiar to find a rule governing the effect that must be accorded federal judgments by other courts ensconced in rules governing the internal procedures of the rendering court itself. Indeed, such a rule would arguably violate the jurisdictional limitation of the Rules Enabling Act: that the Rules “shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right,” 28 U.S.C. §2072(b). . . . In the present case, for example, if California law left petitioner free to sue on this claim in Maryland even after the California statute of limitations had expired, the federal court’s extinguishment of that right (through Rule 41(b)’s mandated claim-preclusive effect of its judgment) would seem to violate this limitation.</p>
<p id="c0f40c51-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, as so interpreted, the Rule would in many cases violate the federalism principle of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78-80 (1938), by engendering “‘substantial’ variations [in outcomes] between state and federal litigation” which would “likely. . . . influence the choice of a forum,” <i>Hanna v. Plumer</i>. See also <i>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York</i>. With regard to the claim-preclusion issue involved in the present case, for example, the traditional rule is that expiration of the applicable statute of limitations merely bars the remedy and does not extinguish the substantive right, so that dismissal on that ground does not have claim-preclusive effect in other jurisdictions with longer, unexpired limitation periods. Out-of-state defendants sued on stale claims in California and in other States adhering to this traditional rule would systematically remove state-law suits brought against them to federal court—where, unless other<span title="715" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-715">p. 715</span>wise specified, a statute-of-limitations dismissal would bar suit everywhere.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102DD_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N102DD_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span> We think the key to a more reasonable interpretation of the meaning of “operates as an adjudication upon the merits” in Rule 41(b) is to be found in Rule 41(a)[(1)(B)], which, in discussing the effect of voluntary dismissal by the plaintiff, makes clear that an “adjudication upon the merits” is the opposite of a “dismissal without prejudice”:</p>

<p id="c0f40c5b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having concluded that the claim-preclusive effect, in Maryland, of this California federal diversity judgment is dictated neither by <i>Dupasseur v. Rochereau</i>, as petitioner contends, nor by Rule 41(b), as respondent contends, we turn to consideration of what determines the issue. Neither the Full Faith and Credit Clause, U.S. Const., <span title="716" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-716">p. 716</span>Art. IV, §1, nor the full faith and credit statute, 28 U.S.C. §1738, addresses the question. By their terms they govern the effects to be given only to state-court judgments (and, in the case of the statute, to judgments by courts of territories and possessions). And no other federal textual provision, neither of the Constitution nor of any statute, addresses the claim-preclusive effect of a judgment in a federal diversity action. . . . </p>
<p id="c0f4336c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is left to us, then, to determine the appropriate federal rule. And despite the sea change that has occurred in the background law since <i>Dupasseur</i> was decided—not only repeal of the Conformity Act but also the watershed decision of this Court in <i>Erie</i>—we think the result decreed by <i>Dupasseur</i> continues to be correct for diversity cases. Since state, rather than federal, substantive law is at issue there is no need for a uniform federal rule. And indeed, nationwide uniformity in the substance of the matter is better served by having the same claim-preclusive rule (the state rule) apply whether the dismissal has been ordered by a state or a federal court. This is, it seems to us, a classic case for adopting, as the federally prescribed rule of decision, the law that would be applied by state courts in the State in which the federal diversity court sits. See <i>Gasperini v. Ctr. for Humanities, Inc</i>. As we have alluded to above, any other rule would produce the sort of “forum-shopping. . . . and. . . . inequitable administration of the laws” that <i>Erie</i> seeks to avoid, since filing in, or removing to, federal court would be encouraged by the divergent effects that the litigants would anticipate from likely grounds of dismissal.

<p id="c0f4336d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This federal reference to state law will not obtain, of course, in situations in which the state law is incompatible with federal interests. If, for example, state law did not accord claim-preclusive effect to dismissals for willful violation of discovery orders, federal courts’ interest in the integrity of their own processes might justify a contrary federal rule. No such conflict with potential federal interests exists in the present case. Dismissal of this state cause of action was decreed by the California federal court only because the California statute of limitations so required; and there is no conceivable federal interest in giving that time bar more effect in other courts than the California courts themselves would impose.</p>
<p id="c0f4336e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the claim-preclusive effect of the California federal court’s dismissal “upon the merits” of petitioner’s action on statute-of-limitations grounds is governed by a federal rule that in turn incorporates California’s law of claim preclusion (the content of which we do not pass upon today), the Maryland Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that the dismissal necessarily precluded the bringing of this action in the Maryland courts.

It was instead a question of how a state court, in a subsequent case, should understand a federal judgment in a diversity action. Specifically, the question was whether the state court should look to federal preclusion doctrine in deciding the scope of the federal diversity judgment. Held: No; instead the second court should give the diversity judgment the same scope <i>as if</i> it had been rendered by a state rather than a federal court.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0f45a8a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further, bear in mind that in claims that might plausibly be brought in several states, states often apply their own statute of limitations (instead of looking to the rules governing the prior court). So, if the <i>Semtek</i> claim had remained in a California state court, which had concluded that the statute of limitations had run, one can imagine the plaintiffs refiling in Maryland and having Maryland decide to apply its longer statute of limitations.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0f45a8c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Maryland court thought Rule 41 required it to give broad application to a federal judgment. Moreover, the Maryland court was correct in one respect. Federal courts have regularly said that involuntary dismissals under Rule 41(b) bar not only the claim pleaded but all claims arising from the transaction or occurrence behind the pleaded claim. To see the breadth of this doctrine, suppose the claim in question had arisen under federal law, the federal court had dismissed with prejudice, and the plaintiff then sought to bring a related claim under state law in a state court. The state court would be required to bar the claim. Federated Dept. Stores v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394 (1981), so holds.</p></li>

<p id="c0f45a90-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice something about one commonly offered justification for preclusion—that it is efficient. It certainly can be. For example, on the facts of <i>Ison v. Thomas</i>, considered in Chapter 1, it might well have saved time for George Ison to combine his property damage and personal injury claims in the same lawsuit: The witnesses, jury, and judge would have had to consider the same evidence—the defendant’s negligence, whether that negligence caused Ison’s injuries, and the extent if any of Ison’s own negligence—only once.</p>
<p id="c0f45a91-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the facts of <i>Frier v. City of Vandalia</i> should also make us just a bit wary about accepting efficiency as the sole justification for preclusion doctrines. Would it really have been more efficient to try Charles Frier’s replevin and due process claims in the same lawsuit? Except for the fact of towing the cars, the evidence presented by the parties would overlap very little: In the replevin action, the central question would be who owned the cars; in the due process claim, the relevant inquiry would center on the circumstances leading to the towing (did the cars pose a hazard or a significant obstruction to traffic) and on the post-towing procedures available to Frier. So one might wonder whether more was at work than efficiency. And, in fact, the cases suggest that besides efficiency, preclusion aims at preventing inconsistent judgments. Consider a very simple case, in which Creditor sues Debtor on an unpaid promissory note and prevails. Could Debtor now turn around and sue Creditor for fraud, claiming that the very note on which Creditor had just won a judgment was the product of fraud? No; in the words of an often-cited case:</p>

<p id="c0f45a92-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A judgment on the merits] is a finality as to the claim or demand in controversy, concluding parties and those in privity with them, not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any <i>other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose</i>. Thus, for example, a judgment rendered on a promissory note is conclusive as to the validity of the instrument and the amount due upon it, although it be subsequently alleged that perfect defenses actually existed, of which no proof was offered, such as forgery, want of consideration, or payment. If such defenses were not presented in the action, and established by competent evidence, <i>the subsequent allegation of their existence is of no consequence.</i></p>

Preclusion doctrines <span title="719" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-719">p. 719</span>say to Defendant/Debtor that she must assert that defense in the first suit—or lose it.

<p id="c0f4a8c9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most commonly, claim preclusion will operate only between those who were the parties to both the first and second lawsuits; by contrast, different parties possess different claims for preclusion purposes, even when those claims arise out of the same transaction. To use <i>Frier</i> again as an example, suppose Charles Frier had a roommate, who also parked cars in the alley, and they were similarly towed. The decision in <i>Frier</i> would not bar roommate’s claim (though Frier’s case might provide a precedential barrier to roommate’s claim).</p>
<p id="c0f4a8ca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The proposition that claim preclusion operates only between the same parties has, however, several exceptions. Imagine, for example, that the owner of Suburbanacre sues Neighbor for trespass, and the court rules that Neighbor enjoys a permanent easement over Owner’s land. If Owner sells Suburbanacre to Buyer, Buyer will be bound by the judgment, even though he was not a party to the action. In buying the land, he “buys” the result of litigation defining the nature of Owner’s rights. Courts describe Buyer as being bound because he is “in privity” with Owner, a phrase that makes sense given the transaction between Owner and Buyer. Courts have sometimes gone even further than this, finding that someone not formally named as a party is so closely connected to a suit that it is appropriate to treat her as if she were named. When they do so, they use the same phrase, “in privity,” to describe the party bound by the first suit. That term is harmless as long as one understands that it merely expresses the conclusion that the person whose name was not on the caption of the first case should nevertheless be bound. When that should happen is the issue before the court in the next case.</p>

Lee, 311 U.S. 32, 40 (1940) [infra page 831]. Several exceptions, recognized in this Court’s decisions, temper this basic rule. In a class action, for example, <span title="721" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-721">p. 721</span>a person not named as a party may be bound by a judgment on the merits of the action, if she was adequately represented by a party who actively participated in the litigation. In this case, we consider for the first time whether there is a “virtual representation” exception to the general rule against precluding nonparties. Adopted by a number of courts, including the courts below in the case now before us, the exception so styled is broader than any we have so far approved. . . . </p>

<p id="c0f4cfe6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first suit was filed by Greg Herrick, an antique aircraft enthusiast and the owner of an F-45 airplane, a vintage model manufactured by the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation (FEAC) in the 1930’s. In 1997, seeking information that would help him restore his plane to its original condition, Herrick filed a FOIA request asking the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for copies of any technical documents about the F-45 contained in the agency’s records.</p>
<p id="c0f4cfe7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To gain a certificate authorizing the manufacture and sale of the F-45, FEAC had submitted to the FAA’s predecessor, the Civil Aeronautics Authority, detailed specifications and other technical data about the plane. Hundreds of pages of documents produced by FEAC in the certification process remain in the FAA’s records. The FAA denied Herrick’s request, however, upon finding that the documents he sought are subject to FOIA’s exemption for “trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential,” 5 U.S.C. §552(b)(4) (2006 ed.). . . . </p>

When the FAA failed to respond, Taylor filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the <span title="722" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-722">p. 722</span>District of Columbia.

<p id="c0f4cfeb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After Fairchild intervened as a defendant, the District Court in D.C. concluded that Taylor’s suit was barred by claim preclusion; accordingly, it granted summary judgment to Fairchild and the FAA. . . . </p>
<p id="c0f4cfec-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record before the District Court in Taylor’s suit revealed the following facts about the relationship between Taylor and Herrick: Taylor is the president of the Antique Aircraft Association, an organization to which Herrick belongs; the two men are “close associate[s]”; Herrick asked Taylor to help restore Herrick’s F-45, though they had no contract or agreement for Taylor’s participation in the restoration; Taylor was represented by the lawyer who represented Herrick in the earlier litigation; and Herrick apparently gave Taylor documents that Herrick had obtained from the FAA during discovery in his suit. . . . </p>

<p id="c0f4f70b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The D.C. Circuit, the FAA, and Fairchild have presented three arguments in support of an expansive doctrine of virtual representation. We find none of them persuasive.</p>

<p id="c0f4f70d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The D.C. Circuit purported to ground its virtual representation doctrine in this Court’s decisions stating that, in some circumstances, a person may be bound by a judgment if she was adequately represented by a party to the proceeding yielding that judgment. But the D.C. Circuit’s definition of “adequate representation” strayed from the meaning our decisions have attributed to that term. . . . </p>

<p id="c0f4f710-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fairchild and the FAA do not argue that the D.C. Circuit’s virtual representation doctrine fits within any of the recognized grounds for nonparty preclusion. Rather, they ask us to abandon the attempt to delineate discrete grounds and clear rules altogether. Preclusion is in order, they contend, whenever “the relationship between a party and a non-party is ‘close enough’ to bring the second litigant within the judgment.” Courts should make the “close enough” determination, they urge, through a “heavily fact-driven” and “equitable” inquiry. . . . </p>
<p id="c0f4f711-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We reject this argument for three reasons. First, our decisions emphasize the fundamental nature of the general rule that a litigant is not bound by a judgment to which she was not a party. . . . </p>
<p id="c0f4f712-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our second reason for rejecting a broad doctrine of virtual representation rests on the limitations attending nonparty preclusion based on adequate representation. A party’s representation of a nonparty is “adequate” for preclusion purposes only if, at a minimum: (1) the interests of the nonparty and her representative are aligned, see <i>Hansberry</i>; and (2) either the party understood herself to be acting in a representative capacity or the original court took care to protect the interests of the nonparty, see <i>Richards.</i> In addition, adequate representation sometimes requires (3) notice of the original suit to the persons alleged to have been represented.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10584_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10584_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">6</a></span> In the class-action context, these limitations are implemented by the procedural safeguards contained in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.</p>
<p id="c0f51e24-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An expansive doctrine of virtual representation, however, would “recogniz[e], in effect, a common-law kind of class action.” That is, virtual representation would authorize preclusion based on identity of interests and some kind of relationship between parties and nonparties, shorn of the procedural protections prescribed in <i>Hansberry</i>, <i>Richards</i>, and Rule 23. These protections, grounded in due process, could be circumvented were we to approve a virtual representation doctrine that allowed courts to “create de facto class actions at will.”</p>
<p id="c0f51e25-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, a diffuse balancing approach to nonparty preclusion would likely create more headaches than it relieves. Most obviously, it could significantly complicate the task of district courts faced in the first instance with preclusion questions. An all-things-considered balancing approach might spark wide-ranging, time-consuming, and expensive discovery tracking factors potentially relevant under seven- or five-prong tests. . . . </p>

<p id="c0f51e27-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally. . . . the FAA maintains that nonparty preclusion should apply more broadly in “public-law” litigation than in “private-law” controversies. To support this position, the FAA offers two arguments. First, the FAA urges, our decision in <i>Richards</i> acknowledges that, in certain cases, the plaintiff has a reduced interest in controlling the litigation “because of the public nature of the right at issue.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0f51e28-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e said in <i>Richards</i> only that, for the type of public-law claims there envisioned, [state and federal legislatures] are free to adopt procedures limiting repetitive litigation [involving public rights]. . . . It hardly follows, however, that this Court should proscribe or confine successive FOIA suits by different requesters. Indeed, Congress’ provision for FOIA suits with no statutory constraint on successive actions counsels against judicial imposition of constraints through extraordinary application of the common law of preclusion.</p>
<p id="c0f51e29-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The FAA next argues that “the threat of vexatious litigation is heightened” in public-law cases because “the number of plaintiffs with standing is potentially limitless.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0f51e2a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But we are not convinced that this risk justifies departure from the usual rules governing nonparty preclusion. First, <i>stare decisis</i> will allow courts swiftly to dispose of repetitive suits brought in the same circuit. Second, even when <i>stare decisis</i> is not dispositive, “the human tendency not to waste money will deter the bringing of suits based on claims or issues that have already been adversely determined against others.” This intuition seems to be borne out by experience: The FAA has not called our attention to any instances of abusive FOIA suits in the Circuits that reject the virtual-representation theory respondents advocate here.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0f54550-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In several cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the Due Process Clause does in fact place limits on state courts’ use of virtual representation. An earlier case cited in <i>Taylor</i>, Richards v. Jefferson County, 517 U.S. 793 (1996), arose <span title="727" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-727">p. 727</span>from an Alabama county’s imposition of an “occupation tax” to finance construction of a new civic center. Several lawsuits challenging the legality of the tax were filed. The first of these, Bedingfield v. Jefferson County, 520 So. 2d 1270 (Ala. 1988), went to the Alabama Supreme Court, which upheld the tax. When Richards filed a separate action, raising federal law challenges to the tax, the Alabama Supreme Court held “that the federal claims as well as the state claims were barred by the adjudication in <i>Bedingfield</i>. . . . [because a] judgment is generally ‘<i>res judicata</i> not only as to all matters litigated and decided by it, but as to all relevant issues which could have been but were not raised and litigated in the suit,’” (quoting Jefferson County v. Richards, 662 So. 2d 1127 (Ala. 1995)).</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0f56c62-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even though the Alabama Supreme Court was entirely conventional in its statement of claim preclusion doctrine, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed. It did so because Alabama had applied claim preclusion not to the original parties in the suit but to new parties on the grounds that there was “substantial identity of the parties” in the first and second lawsuits.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0f56c63-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">State courts are generally free to develop their own rules for protecting against the relitigation of common issues or the piecemeal resolution of disputes. We have long held, however, that extreme applications of the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> may be inconsistent with a federal right that is “fundamental in character.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0f56c64-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The limits on a state court’s power to develop estoppel rules reflect the general consensus “’in Anglo-American jurisprudence that one is not bound by a judgment in personam in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process.’ <i>Hansberry v. Lee</i> [infra page 831]. . . . This rule is part of our ‘deep-rooted historic tradition that everyone should have his own day in court.’” <i>Martin v. Wilks</i> [infra page 819] . . . . </p>
<p id="c0f56c65-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, these principles do not always require one to have been a party to a judgment in order to be bound by it. Most notably, there is an exception when it can be said that there is “privity” between a party to the second case and a party who is bound by an earlier judgment. For example, a judgment that is binding on a guardian or trustee may also bind the ward or the beneficiaries of a trust. Moreover. . . . the term “privity” is now used to describe various relationships between litigants that would not have come within the traditional definition of that term. See generally Restatement (Second) of Judgments, ch. 4 (1980). . . . [The Court said the procedure followed in this case did not satisfy the conditions for “privity."]</p>
<p id="c0f56c66-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We begin by noting that the parties to the <i>Bedingfield</i> case failed to provide petitioners with any notice that a suit was pending which would conclusively resolve their legal rights. That failure is troubling because, as we explained in <i>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co.</i> [supra page 165], the right to be heard ensured by the guarantee of due process “has little reality or worth unless one is informed that the matter is pending and can choose for himself whether to appear or default, acquiesce or contest.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0f56c67-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, respondents ask us to excuse the lack of notice on the ground that petitioners, as the Alabama Supreme Court concluded, were adequately represented in <i>Bedingfield</i>. . . . </p>

<p id="c0f56c69-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . [T]here is no reason to suppose that the <i>Bedingfield</i> court took care to protect the interests of petitioners in the manner suggested in <i>Hansberry</i>. Nor is there any reason to suppose that the individual taxpayers in <i>Bedingfield</i> understood their suit to be on behalf of absent county taxpayers. Thus, to contend that the plaintiffs in <i>Bedingfield</i> somehow represented petitioners, let alone represented them in a constitutionally adequate manner, would be “to attribute to them a power that it cannot be said that they had assumed to exercise.” <i>Hansberry</i>. . . . </p>
<p id="c0f56c6a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, we are aware that governmental and private entities have substantial interests in the prompt and determinative resolution of challenges to important legislation. We do not agree with the Alabama Supreme Court, however, that, given the amount of money at stake, respondents were entitled to rely on the assumption that the <i>Bedingfield</i> action “authoritatively established” the constitutionality of the tax. A state court’s freedom to rely on prior precedent in rejecting a litigant’s claims does not afford it similar freedom to bind a litigant to a prior judgment to which he was not a party. That general rule clearly applies when a taxpayer seeks a hearing to prevent the State from subjecting him to a levy in violation of the Federal Constitution.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0f56c6c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice that, although the <i>Richards</i> Court was applying the Due Process Clause, rather than the common law of preclusion, its concerns and its language sound remarkably like <i>Taylor v. Sturgell</i>. It may be helpful to imagine that when a judge or justice thinks about applying preclusion to someone not a party to the prior lawsuit, the judge imagines that the Due Process Clause is peering over her shoulder as she shapes the common law of preclusion.</p></li>

<p id="c0f59383-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court addresses the distinction just drawn when the opinion notes “’the human tendency not to waste money will deter the bringing of suits based on claims or issues that have already been adversely determined against others.’ This intuition seems to be borne out by experience: The FAA has not called our attention to any instances of abusive FOIA suits in the Circuits that reject the virtual-representation theory respondents advocate here.” Explain why this passage addresses the difference between preclusion and precedent<i>.</i></p>

A divorcing Utah couple, Edlean and Woodey Searle, were litigating the division of marital property. One asset was a second home known as Slaugh House. Woodey, the husband, contended that the property was not in fact entirely a marital asset, claiming that he and the couple’s two sons, Randy and Rhett, held Slaugh House as a partnership—though there was no document recording that co-ownership. Randy and Rhett testified at trial in support of Woodey’s contention concerning the partnership, but the trial court was not persuaded, and divided the property as if it had been wholly owned by the couple. After the divorce was final, Randy and Rhett sued their mother, contending—again—that the property was partly theirs because they owned it in partnership with their father. Edlean argued that her sons’ lawsuit was barred, because they had been “virtually represented” by Woodey in the divorce litigation.</p>

<p id="c0f59389-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts and treatises sometimes say that claim preclusion requires a prior final judgment. Like the proposition that claim preclusion applies only between the same parties, courts do not literally interpret the final judgment requirement. For example, some administrative determinations may be entitled to claim-preclusion effect if the procedure employed contains sufficient due process protections.</p>
<p id="c0f5938a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More important is the effect of an appeal on a judgment’s status.

<p id="c0f5ba9d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not all final judgments, even though they involve the same claim and the same parties, receive preclusive effect. All agree that a judgment after a full trial is undoubtedly entitled to preclusive effect. Short of that, however, when ought preclusive effect to attach? The problem is difficult because courts might want to assign preclusive effect to a judgment for two quite different reasons. One reason, of course, is that the court considered and decided the merits of the lawsuit. A different reason would be that the party had misbehaved (for example, refused to obey court orders) and the court dismissed the suit as a sanction. Such a dismissal would have nothing to do with the merits of the complaint, but the sanction would be futile unless it barred the refiling of the suit. Unfortunately, courts sometimes discuss this problem by stating that preclusive effect ought to attach only to judgments “on the merits.” Like “in privity,” this phrase conceals more than it explains, because it begs the real question: For what reasons and under what circumstances should we attach preclusive effect to a judgment? In studying this question, try to put the deceptive “on the merits” phrase out of your mind.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0f5e1bc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How did you answer Problem 1d? This problem—how to treat a judgment following a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6)—presents an issue that calls one’s entire understanding of procedure into question. On the one hand, such a dismissal can be for essentially formal reasons: The plaintiff’s lawyer forgot that one must allege an agreement as part of a breach of contract suit. If the underlying facts suggest an agreement, it seems unjust to preclude when a sentence added to the pleading would have cured the problem. On the other hand, if the plaintiff’s lawyer has alleged all that can truthfully be alleged and the complaint is still dismissed, isn’t that a statement about the merits of a claim?</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0f5e1bd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One might think that one reason to treat Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals as preclusive flows from the ease of amending pleadings. It is axiomatic that a trial court should not dismiss a pleading for failure to state a claim without granting plaintiff at least one opportunity to amend; a trial court’s dismissal without leave to amend would be strong grounds for reversal. Suppose plaintiff does amend, and the trial court nevertheless dismisses the amended complaint. Is the opportunity to amend—after being instructed by the trial court what was wrong with the original complaint—a sufficient assurance that plaintiff has stated any possible claim, and therefore justification for assigning preclusive effect? In Federated Department Stores v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394 (1981), the Supreme Court apparently accepted such reasoning, in a footnote that, in its entirety, reads: “The dismissal for failure to state a claim under Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6) is a ‘judgment on the merits.’” Id. at 399 n.3. The statement was necessary to the decision of the case and is thus a holding, but the Court did not explain its justification for this conclusion.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0f5e1be-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not all states follow the same rule. For example, see In re Estate of Cochrane, 72 Ill. App. 3d 812, 391 N.E.2d 35 (1979) (under Illinois procedural law, dismissal for failure to plead enough facts to state a claim does not bar a second suit with the necessary facts added; presumably it would bar bringing a suit based on an identically worded complaint); Keidatz v. Albany, 39 Cal. 2d 826, 249 P.2d 264 (1952) (dismissal on demurrer bars subsequent action on complaint alleging same facts but does not bar claim raising new issues or new facts in support of same claim). Is it possible to decide which rule is preferable without taking into account the pleading regime of the jurisdiction in <span title="732" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-732">p. 732</span>question? Recall that after <i>Semtek Intl. Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp.</i> (supra page 713) the judgment of a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction will be the same as that of a state court in that state. Thus a federal diversity judgment by a federal court in Illinois or California would get the same scope as a state court judgment—so that the federal judgment would not preclude a second complaint on the same claim, properly alleged.</p></li>

A bit of background: Congress has given the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over federal securities fraud claims. If such a claim is filed in state court, the state court should therefore dismiss it. Apparently neither the state judge nor the parties appearing before him knew that principle, and the resulting mess came before the Sixth Circuit to be sorted out.</p></li>

In response, Mr. Gargallo filed an answer and counterclaim against Merrill Lynch, alleging that Merrill Lynch caused his losses through “negligence, misrepresentations, and churning,” and that the firm had violated. . . . federal securities laws. After a considerable history of discovery difficulties, the state court dismissed Mr. Gargallo’s counterclaim “with prejudice,” citing Ohio Civil Rule 37 [substantially identical to Federal Rule 37], for refusal to comply with Merrill Lynch’s discovery requests and the court’s discovery orders. . . . </p>

Merrill Lynch et al.,</i> supra page 732, when Larry Tyree, the Merrill Lynch stockbroker sued by Gargallo, sought to use the issues established in the first suit against Gargallo in the second, federal suit, the court’s answer was swift and clear:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0f6cb65-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to the summary judgment in favor of Larry Tyree, since Mr. Gargallo’s counter claim was dismissed in the state court as a sanction for discovery violations, none of the factual or legal issues he raised were actually litigated and decided. Consequently, the doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is not applicable.</p>

Bertha recovered a $30,000 judgment on her claim, and judgment was rendered for Illinois Central on Jessie’s claim.</p>
<p id="c0f6f27e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jessie then sued Illinois Central for his own injuries.

<p id="c0f6f280-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Estoppel by judgment precludes the relitigation of a <i>cause of action</i> finally determined between the parties, and decrees that a judgment rendered is a complete bar to any subsequent action on <i>the same claim or cause of action</i>.

<p id="c0f6f282-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To protect the integrity of the prior judgment by precluding the possibility of opposite results by two different juries on the same set of facts, the doctrine of estoppel by verdict allows the judgment in the prior action to operate as an estoppel as to those facts or questions actually litigated and determined in the prior action. The problem at hand, then, is to determine what facts or questions were actually litigated and determined in the companion case.</p>
<p id="c0f6f283-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with three concessions made by Illinois Central Gulf as to the effect of the verdict in the prior case: (1) that the verdict in favor of Bertha established, among other things, that the railroad was negligent and that its negligence was a proximate cause of the accident and Bertha’s injuries; (2) that, inasmuch as Jessie’s action for loss of services and consortium was derivative, if Jessie sustained any such loss it was proximately caused by the railroad’s negligence; and (3) that, in order for the jury to have returned a verdict against Jessie, it had to have decided that he either sustained no damages or that his own negligence was a proximate cause of his damages.</p>
<p id="c0f6f284-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This third proposition places upon the railroad the heavy burden outlined by Judge Shake in [Flora v. Indiana Service Co., 222 Ind. App. 253, 256-57 (1944)]:</p>

The estoppel of a judgment is only presumptively conclusive, when it appears that the judgment could not have been rendered without deciding the particular matter brought in question.

<p id="c0f6f286-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The railroad argues that, because Jessie’s evidence as to his loss of services and consortium was uncontroverted, the jury’s verdict had to be based upon a finding of contributory negligence.

We reviewed the complete record in the companion case and held that the jury verdict against Jessie in that cause could mean that he had failed his burden of proving compensable damages. . . . </p>
<p id="c0f6f288-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that Illinois Central Gulf has failed its burden of showing that the judgment against Jessie in the prior action could not have been rendered without deciding that Jessie was contributorily negligent in the accident which precipitated the two <span title="740" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-740">p. 740</span>lawsuits. Consequently, the trial court was correct in granting partial summary judgment estopping the railroad from denying its negligence and in limiting the issues at trial to whether Jessie was contributorily negligent, whether any such contributory negligence was a proximate cause of the accident, and whether Jessie sustained personal injuries and compensable damages. . . . </p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0f719a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF ISSUE PRECLUSION?</p></div>
<p id="c0f719a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a typical opinion explains, “[a]pplication of the doctrine of [issue preclusion] represents a decision that the needs of judicial finality and efficiency outweigh the possible gains of fairness or accuracy from continued litigation of an issue that previously has been considered by a competent tribunal.” Nasem v. Brown, 595 F.2d 801 (D.C. Cir. 1979).</p>
<p id="c0f719a7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Efficiency? Maybe it saves time not to relitigate an issue, but against that one has to count the time figuring out whether issue preclusion should apply.</p>
<p id="c0f740b8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider another explanation: Professor Martin Shapiro has argued that “it must always be remembered that the basic aim of a trial is to resolve a conflict or to impose social controls, not to find the facts. Much of what may appear to be unsatisfactory as pure fact-finding, if we were applying general scientific canons for empirical inquiry, may be quite satisfactory in the specific context of trials.” Shapiro, Courts: A Comparative and Political Analysis 44 (1981). If Professor Shapiro’s analysis is correct, courts are understandably hesitant to transplant the “findings” to a second dispute because it is a different dispute. The requirements that hedge issue preclusion thus grow from courts’ understandable reluctance to equate “findings” with “facts.”</p>

<p id="c0f740bb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Illinois Gulf Central R. v. Parks</i>, the court declined to apply preclusion because the opacity of the general verdict made it difficult to determine what the first judgment had decided. Sometimes courts face the opposite problem: too many findings in support of a judgment. In a trial to the bench, Rule 52(a) requires the judge to set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law. Imagine that the trial in <i>Parks</i> had taken place before a judge, who had determined (1) that Illinois Central had not been negligent and (2) that Jessie Parks had been contributorily negligent. Under these circumstances, should the court in a subsequent claim between the same parties hold Jessie precluded from relitigating both those issues? Or neither one? That question, though it occurs infrequently, reveals the values underlying the doctrine. The first Restatement of Judgments took the position that when alternative grounds for decision existed, <i>both</i> should be precluded in subsequent litigation. The Restatement (Second) of Judgments §27 comment i says that <i>neither</i> determination should be binding in subsequent litigation. The Reporters’ note to the Restatement (Second) explained their thinking:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0f740bc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, a determination in the alternative may not have been as carefully or rigorously considered as it would have if it had been necessary to the result, and in that sense it has some of the characteristics of dicta.

Put yourself in the position of the plaintiff in the hypothetical lawsuit. You have just lost big in federal district court, with the judge throwing your lawsuit out of court on two alternative grounds. One of those grounds was that the defendant had insufficient contacts with the state to permit personal jurisdiction.

In that world, a judge will have less reason to be careful about any particular finding if there are other independent grounds leading to the same result. The losing litigant will have less incentive to appeal any particular finding if it seems likely that the appellate court will affirm on the basis of the other, independent grounds for decision. Under those circumstances, the theory goes, too few people have an incentive to make sure the findings are accurate. That being the case, we should be reluctant to import those findings into a second lawsuit.</p>

<p id="c0f767e7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have thus far dealt with situations in which the former and the present lawsuits involve the same parties. Common law required this identity of parties (called “mutuality") for both claim preclusion and issue preclusion. It continues to be a requirement for claim preclusion; in recent decades, however, many courts have abandoned this requirement for issue preclusion.</p>
<p id="c0f767e8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To see how such a scheme might operate, consider a variation on the facts in <i>Illinois Central Gulf Railroad v. Parks</i>. Wife alone sues Railroad for injuries suffered in a crossing collision. Wife wins a judgment. Husband now sues for his injuries sustained in the same accident. Railroad cannot argue that his claim is precluded by the first lawsuit: Biologically separate individuals possess separate claims, and no rule compels such individuals, even when married to each other, to prosecute their claims together. So Husband’s suit can go forward.</p>
<p id="c0f767e9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Husband v. Railroad</i>, can either party take advantage of issue preclusion? Seventy-five years ago, the answer was a clear no. Like claim preclusion, issue preclusion applied only if the parties in the second suit both had been parties in the first suit, and, because Husband was not a party to that first lawsuit, the conditions for issue preclusion were not met: “Mutuality”—conditions under which both parties could benefit from or be burdened with preclusion—did not exist. The last several decades have seen that principle of mutuality erode. Many courts today would permit Husband, even though he had not been a party to the first suit, to take advantage of an issue fully litigated and determined in that suit. In such a case Railroad’s negligence, causation, and proximate causation would all be candidates for preclusion in the second action. The rationale for that extension of issue preclusion is that the victim of issue preclusion (here, Railroad) had a full and fair opportunity to litigate those issues in the first suit.</p>
<p id="c0f767ea-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now change one factor: What if Railroad had won the first suit, demonstrating to the jury’s satisfaction that it was not negligent? Could it take advantage of that determination in a second action brought by Husband? The answer is no. Whether they attribute this result to simple fairness or to due process, all agree that a party who has never had an opportunity to litigate an issue cannot be precluded from doing so. (<i>Taylor v. Sturgell,</i> supra page 720, illustrates these principles in the claim preclusion context.) The abandonment of mutuality thus creates a potential asymmetry: If Railroad loses the first case brought by Wife, it will be saddled by that loss in subsequent litigation with Husband. If it wins against Wife, however, <span title="745" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-745">p. 745</span>it must still defend against Husband.

The requirements of due process of law forbid the assertion of a plea of. . . . [issue preclusion] against a party unless he was bound by the earlier litigation in which the matter was decided. He is bound by that litigation only if he has been a party thereto or in privity with a party thereto.

<p id="c0f78f04-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case presents the question whether a party who has had issues of fact adjudicated adversely to it in an equitable action may be collaterally estopped from relitigating the same issues before a jury in a subsequent legal action brought against it by a new party.</p>
<p id="c0f78f05-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The respondent brought this stockholder’s class action against the petitioners in a Federal District Court. The complaint alleged that the petitioners, Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. (Parklane), and 13 of its officers, directors, and stockholders, had issued a materially false and misleading proxy statement in connection with a merger.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B89_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10B89_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span> The proxy statement, according to the complaint, had violated §§14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as various rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The complaint sought damages, rescission of the merger, and recovery of costs.</p>
<p id="c0f78f07-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before this action came to trial, the SEC filed suit against the same defendants in the Federal District Court, alleging that the proxy statement that had been issued by Parklane was materially false and misleading in essentially the same respects as those that had been alleged in the respondent’s complaint. Injunctive relief was requested. After a four-day trial, the District Court found that the proxy statement was materially <span title="746" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-746">p. 746</span>false and misleading in the respects alleged, and entered a declaratory judgment to that effect.

<p id="c0f78f08-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The respondent in the present case then moved for partial summary judgment against the petitioners, asserting that the petitioners were collaterally estopped from litigating the issues that had been resolved against them in the action brought by the SEC.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B99_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10B99_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">2</a></span> The District Court denied the motion on the ground that such an application of collateral estoppel would deny the petitioners their Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, holding that a party who has had issues of fact determined against him after a full and fair opportunity to litigate in a nonjury trial is collaterally estopped from obtaining a subsequent jury trial of these same issues of fact. The appellate court concluded that “the Seventh Amendment preserves the right to jury trial only with respect to issues of fact, [and] once those issues have been fully and fairly adjudicated in a prior proceeding, nothing remains for trial, either with or without a jury.” Because of an inter-Circuit conflict, we granted certiorari.</p>

<p id="c0f7b61e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Collateral estoppel, like the related doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BBB_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10BBB_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">5</a></span> has the dual purpose of protecting litigants from the burden of relitigating an identical issue with the same party or his privy and of promoting judicial economy by preventing needless litigation. Until relatively recently, however, the scope of collateral estoppel was limited by the doctrine of mutuality of parties. Under this mutuality <span title="747" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-747">p. 747</span>doctrine, neither party could use a prior judgment as an estoppel against the other unless both parties were bound by the judgment.

<p id="c0f7b621-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By failing to recognize the obvious difference in position between a party who has never litigated an issue and one who has fully litigated and lost, the mutuality requirement was criticized almost from its inception.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BD0_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10BD0_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">8</a></span> Recognizing the validity of this criticism, the Court in <i>Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundation</i>, supra, abandoned the mutuality requirement. . . . The “broader question” before the Court, however, was “whether it is any longer tenable to afford a litigant more than one full and fair opportunity for judicial resolution of the same issue.”  . . . </p>

<p id="c0f7b624-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Blonder-Tongue</i> case involved defensive use of collateral estoppel—a plaintiff was estopped from asserting a claim that the plaintiff had previously litigated and lost against another defendant. The present case, by contrast, involves offensive use of collateral estoppel—a plaintiff is seeking to estop a defendant from relitigating the issues which the defendant previously litigated and lost against another plaintiff. In both the offensive and defensive use situations, the party against whom estoppel is asserted has litigated and lost in an earlier action. Nevertheless, several reasons have been advanced why the two situations should be treated differently.</p>
<p id="c0f7b625-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, offensive use of collateral estoppel does not promote judicial economy in the same manner as defensive use does. Defensive use of collateral estoppel precludes a plaintiff from relitigating identical issues by merely “switching adversaries.” <i>Bernhard v. Bank of America Natl. Trust &amp; Savings Assn</i>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BFA_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10BFA_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">12</a></span> Thus defensive collateral estoppel gives a plaintiff a strong incentive to join all potential defendants in the first action if possible. Offensive use of collateral estoppel, on the other hand, creates precisely the opposite incentive. Since a plaintiff will be able to rely on a previous judgment against a defendant but will not be bound by that judgment if the defendant wins, the plaintiff has every incentive to adopt a “wait and see” attitude, in the hope that the first action by another plaintiff will result in a favorable judgment. <span title="748" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-748">p. 748</span>Thus offensive use of collateral estoppel will likely increase rather than decrease the total amount of litigation, since potential plaintiffs will have everything to gain and nothing to lose by not intervening in the first action.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C02_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10C02_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">13</a></span> A second argument against offensive use of collateral estoppel is that it may be unfair to a defendant. If a defendant in the first action is sued for small or nominal damages, he may have little incentive to defend vigorously, particularly if future suits are not foreseeable. The <i>Evergreens v. Nunan</i>; cf. <i>Berner v. British Commonwealth Pac. Airlines</i> (application of offensive collateral estoppel denied where defendant did not appeal an adverse judgment awarding damages of $35,000 and defendant was later sued for over $7 million). Allowing offensive collateral estoppel may also be unfair to a defendant if the judgment relied upon as a basis for the estoppel is itself inconsistent with one or more previous judgments in favor of the defendant.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C0E_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10C0E_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">14</a></span> Still another situation where it might be unfair to apply offensive estoppel is where the second action affords the defendant procedural opportunities unavailable in the first action that could readily cause a different result.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C17_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10C17_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">15</a></span></p>

<p id="c0f7dd3b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have concluded that the preferable approach for dealing with these problems in the federal courts is not to preclude the use of offensive collateral estoppel, but to grant trial courts broad discretion to determine when it should be applied.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C27_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10C27_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">16</a></span> The general rule should be that in cases where a plaintiff could easily have joined in the earlier action or where, either for the reasons discussed above or for other reasons, the application of offensive estoppel would be unfair to a defendant, a trial judge should not allow the use of offensive collateral estoppel.</p>
<p id="c0f7dd3d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case, however, none of the circumstances that might justify reluctance to allow the offensive use of collateral estoppel is present. The application of <span title="749" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-749">p. 749</span>offensive collateral estoppel will not here reward a private plaintiff who could have joined in the previous action, since the respondent probably could not have joined in the injunctive action brought by the SEC even had he so desired.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C33_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10C33_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">17</a></span> Similarly, there is no unfairness to the petitioners in applying offensive collateral estoppel in this case. First, in light of the serious allegations made in the SEC’s complaint against the petitioners, as well as the foreseeability of subsequent private suits that typically follow a successful Government judgment, the petitioners had every incentive to litigate the SEC lawsuit fully and vigorously.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C3B_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10C3B_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">18</a></span> Second, the judgment in the SEC action was not inconsistent with any previous decision. Finally, there will in the respondent’s action be no procedural opportunities available to the petitioners that were unavailable in the first action of a kind that might be likely to cause a different result.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C41_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10C41_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">19</a></span> We conclude, therefore, that none of the considerations that would justify a refusal to allow the use of offensive collateral estoppel is present in this case. Since the petitioners received a “full and fair” opportunity to litigate their claims in the SEC action, the contemporary law of collateral estoppel leads inescapably to the conclusion that the petitioners are collaterally estopped from relitigating the question of whether the proxy statement was materially false and misleading.</p>

<p id="c0f8528c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is a glaring exception to the Court’s endorsement of nonmutual preclusion: the federal government. In United States v. Mendoza, 464 U.S. 154 (1984), the Court held that the United States could not be subjected to nonmutual issue preclusion. The ordinary rules of issue preclusion apply if Party and the United States are involved in two successive lawsuits, but if <i>A</i> sues the United States and prevails, <i>B</i> may not in a later suit use against the United States those issues determined in <i>A</i>’s favor. Otherwise put, the principles of <i>Parklane</i> do not apply to the United States. Why not? The <i>Mendoza</i> Court did not do a very good job of justifying its result, but one can imagine two reasons.</p>
<p id="c0f8528d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is a practical problem. At present the United States appeals selectively, choosing only those cases in which some principle of law or fact important to the United States is at stake. (The office of the Solicitor General makes these discretionary judgments.) The <i>Mendoza</i> Court worried that applying <i>Parklane</i> to the United States would force the government to appeal virtually every case it lost, for fear of its effect in subsequent cases. Note that this same problem afflicts other large litigants—state governments, Microsoft, General Motors, large insurers—but no such exception has been carved out for them.</p>
<p id="c0f8528e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The United States faces another problem. Some of the suits to which it is a party involve constitutional questions. As things now stand, an unappealed decision of a district court involving a constitutional question affects only the parties involved in the case itself. It does not even bind other courts in the same district. If one applied <i>Parklane</i> to the United States, all that would change. A single district court decision against the United States on a constitutional issue would become—by virtue of issue preclusion—super-precedent that would bind all other courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court. For example, suppose a district court in the course of a criminal trial ruled that all searches of automobiles without a warrant were unconstitutional. If that ruling stood, it could be applied against the United States by all subsequent defendants. Moreover, unlike ordinary precedent, the ruling would not be subject to reconsideration or “overruling” by the U.S. Supreme Court. Is this a good enough reason not to extend <i>Parklane</i> to the United States? Or does it suggest a narrower exception involving only questions of constitutional law?</p>

Century Home Components, 275 Or. 97, 550 P.2d 1185 (1976). A fire broke out in a light-industrial strip mall, burning a number of businesses. Fifty of those businesses sued Century Home Components (one of the strip-mall tenants), alleging that its negligent treatment of a dumpster full of sawdust and oil had caused the fire to break out. The first two cases tried resulted in defense verdicts. On appeal the first judgment was reversed on account of defendant’s failure to produce a document in discovery. The third case tried resulted in a plaintiff’s verdict, as did the first case on retrial. At that point the remaining litigants moved to preclude defendant on the issues of negligence and causation, leaving only damages to be tried. Plaintiffs reasoned that there were two plaintiff’s verdicts, the issues were identical, and because Oregon had adopted nonmutual preclusion, they were entitled to take advantage of preclusion. The Oregon Supreme Court thought otherwise:</p>

<p id="c0f85293-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “multiple-claimant anomaly” was first hypothesized by Brainerd Currie as one instance where, absent mutuality, the unrestrained application of collateral estoppel might produce unfair results. Currie, Mutuality of Collateral Estoppel: Limits of the Bernhard Doctrine, 9 Stan. L. Rev. 281 (1957). Currie posed the situation of a train wreck resulting in 50 separate claims being filed against the railroad for negligence. If the defendant railroad won the first 25 cases and subsequently lost the 26th, Currie characterized as an “absurdity” the notion that the remaining 24 claimants could ride in on the strength of the 26th plaintiff’s judgment and estop the defendant on the issue of negligence. The reason was that the 26th judgment would clearly seem to be an aberration. Currie then reasoned that, if we should be unwilling to give preclusive effect to the 26th judgment, we should not afford such effect to an adverse judgment rendered in the <i>first</i> action brought because “we have no warrant for assuming that the aberrational judgment will not come as the first in the series.” Currie, supra. Currie thus concluded that, absent mutuality, collateral estoppel should not be applied where a defendant potentially faces more than two successive actions.</p>
<p id="c0f879a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those courts which have discarded the rule of mutuality and permit the offensive assertion of collateral estoppel have generally rejected Currie’s solution to the multiple-claimant anomaly in situations where the <i>first</i> judgment is adverse to the defendant, and have precluded a defendant from relitigating multiple claims where it has been concluded that the defendant had in actuality the incentive and complete opportunity to contest the issue fully in the first action. Currie’s reservations were based on the apprehension that the first judgment might well be an aberration, but this view failed to recognize that the very notion of collateral estoppel demands and assumes a certain confidence in the integrity of the end result of our adjudicative process. . . . </p>
<p id="c0f879a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the foregoing discussion would indicate, however, we are not free to disregard incongruous results when they are looking us in the eye. If the circumstances are such that our confidence in the integrity of the determination is severely undermined, or that the result would likely be different in a second trial, it would work an injustice to deny the litigant another chance. Thus, <span title="754" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-754">p. 754</span>where it is apparent that the verdict was the result of a jury compromise, the losing party should not be precluded by the judgment. . . . It has also been held that if the prior determination was manifestly erroneous the judgment should not be given preclusive effect. Restatement (Second) of Judgments §88(7) and Comment i. (Tent. Draft No. 2, 1975). And the existence of newly discovered or crucial evidence that was not available to the litigant at the first trial would provide a basis for denying preclusion where it appears the evidence would have a significant effect on the outcome.</p>
<p id="c0f879a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the commentators to the extent at least that, where there are extant determinations that are inconsistent on the matter in issue, it is a strong indication that the application of collateral estoppel would work an injustice.

The final catchall exception is designed to help courts out of messes that inconsistent prior decisions can lead to.</p>
<p id="c0f8c7e8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Apart from these rather unusual circumstances, courts take claim preclusion very seriously, even when the prior decision has obviously been erroneous. Recall <i>Gargallo v. Merrill Lynch et al.,</i> supra page 732, in which the lower court gave preclusive effect to a state court judgment on a claim over which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>

<p id="c0f9161b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This chapter has focused on a pair of common law doctrines that prevent subsequent lawsuits from undermining judgments. Claim preclusion, by preventing subsequent litigation of the same claim, requires the parties to include related grievances in the same suit. Issue preclusion prevents inconsistent findings when subsequent litigation is permitted. We turn now to two principles that ensure that courts heed the doctrines of former adjudication without producing unfair hardship.</p>
<p id="c0f9161c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To see their relationship, consider a hypothetical case. Motorists from New York and New Jersey collide with each other. New Jersey plaintiff sues New York defendant in New Jersey state court and loses. Could plaintiff try again by going to New York and suing there in either state or federal court? Or suppose that after the <span title="758" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-758">p. 758</span>original case has gone to judgment, plaintiff discovers a witness who supplies the crucial missing evidence of defendant’s negligence; moreover, plaintiff discovers that defendant knew of the witness but failed to reveal his existence in response to interrogatories. Can plaintiff somehow bring this evidence before the court? The doctrines of claim preclusion do not answer the first question because, as common law doctrines under state law, they speak only to the courts of a given jurisdiction: On the facts given, they tell the New Jersey courts that N.J. Motorist cannot bring a second suit in that state; but they say nothing to the courts of New York. As the next section shows, principles of full faith and credit back up the common law by insisting that courts of one jurisdiction heed the judgments of another, here telling N.Y. courts to heed the N.J. judgment. But the doctrines of former adjudication, reinforced by full faith and credit, have the potential to work injustice if, for example, they perpetuate defendant’s fraudulent concealment of evidence in the second hypothetical. To prevent that, legislatures have created the opportunity, in very limited circumstances, to reopen a judgment.</p>
<div id="c0f9161d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0f9161e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">1.&nbsp;Full Faith and Credit as a Bar to Collateral Attack</p></h3></div>

<p id="c0f9161f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common law doctrines of claim and issue preclusion require courts of any given political unit to heed the judgments of courts of that unit. They give, however, no guidance respecting the judgments of sister jurisdictions—other states or the federal government. Two provisions of law fill that silence. The Constitution, in Article IV, obligates state courts to recognize sister-state judgments—to give them, in the Constitution’s words “Full Faith and Credit.” Section 1738 of 28 U.S.C. demands that all courts, state and federal, give the same full faith and credit to state court judgments as those states would themselves give. This rule makes sense: Parties litigating in the courts of one state should know in advance what the preclusive effects of any ruling will be.</p>

<p id="c0f91620-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though §1738 does not mention full faith and credit to federal court judgments, that requirement has always been assumed and is not questioned, either as a proposition of federal common law or, as some would have it, an implication of the Supremacy Clause, found in Article VI ("This Constitution and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof. . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereb. . . . ").</p>

<p id="c0f91621-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If one puts these provisions together with the common law of preclusion, they create an apparently seamless web. Within any given political unit, the applicable common law doctrine of preclusion prevents attacks on the judgment. Although, as we have seen, the doctrine of preclusion may differ in certain ways from state to state (for example, some states recognize the “same transaction or occurrence” test for the scope of claim preclusion, while others may recognize a “same evidence” test), the generally applied doctrine is clear: Any claim that was or could have been litigated in the previous case may not be relitigated, and any issue that was litigated may not be relitigated in a second proceeding by a disappointed litigant. Put in legal terms, “collateral attack” on the outcome of Case 1 is not available in Case 2. Across the boundaries of political units—what is called “interjurisdictional preclusion”—the principles of full faith and credit require that the courts of one unit <span title="759" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-759">p. 759</span>give to sister courts’ judgments the same effect they would have in the unit that rendered them. We have already seen these principles in operation in <i>Gargallo v. Merrill Lynch et al.</i>, supra page 732, and <i>Frier v. City of Vandalia</i>, supra page 705.</p>
<p id="c0f91622-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is, however, a hole—of indeterminate size—in this doctrinal tapestry: Under some circumstances one may collaterally attack a judgment—that is, contest the enforceability in Case 2 of a judgment reached in Case 1—on the ground that the court rendering the judgment lacked jurisdiction to decide it. (That is one of the holdings of <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>, supra page 68.) In principle, this makes sense: A party should not be bound by a judgment reached by a court that lacked power to render it. Nineteenth-century courts often asserted this proposition in sweeping terms, saying that a judgment entered without jurisdiction was “void.” One implication of that proposition was that such a judgment was not entitled to full faith and credit—and that giving it full faith and credit might itself violate the Constitution. Again, <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>, where personal jurisdiction over the defendant was lacking in the first case, is a classic example of this proposition.</p>
<p id="c0f91623-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Put in the most general terms, the objection that a judgment was invalid for want of jurisdiction created a significant exception to the doctrines of finality. More recent decisions have clarified and limited this “jurisdictional” exception, helping to maintain the power of the doctrine of preclusion to produce genuine finality in litigation. For example, <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i> makes clear that lack of personal jurisdiction in Case 1 can be a legitimate basis for collaterally attacking the judgment reached in that case in Case 2. Can the same be said when the problem in Case 1 is the absence of <i>subject matter</i> jurisdiction? The next case (involving the subject matter jurisdiction of a state rather than a federal court) considers that question.</p>

<p id="c0f91629-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A Georgia court entered a final judgment of adoption making petitioner V.L. a legal parent of the children that she and respondent E.L. had raised together from birth. V.L. and E.L. later separated while living in Alabama. V.L. asked the Alabama courts to enforce the Georgia judgment and grant her custody or visitation rights. The Alabama Supreme Court ruled against her, holding that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution does not require the Alabama courts to respect the Georgia judgment. That judgment of the Alabama Supreme Court is now reversed by this summary disposition.</p>

<p id="c0f93c3c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">V.L. and E.L. eventually decided to give legal status to the relationship between V.L. and the children by having V.L. formally adopt them. To facilitate the adoption, the <span title="760" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-760">p. 760</span>couple rented a house in Alpharetta, Georgia. V.L. then filed an adoption petition in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia. E.L. also appeared in that proceeding. While not relinquishing her own parental rights, she gave her express consent to V.L.’s adoption of the children as a second parent. The Georgia court determined that V.L. had complied with the applicable requirements of Georgia law, and entered a final decree of adoption allowing V.L. to adopt the children and recognizing both V.L. and E.L. as their legal parents.</p>
<p id="c0f93c3d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">V.L. and E.L. ended their relationship in 2011, while living in Alabama. . . . V.L. later filed a petition in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama, alleging that E.L. had denied her access to the children and interfered with her ability to exercise her parental rights.

<p id="c0f93c40-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution provides that “Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.” That Clause requires each State to recognize and give effect to valid judgments rendered by the courts of its sister States. It serves “to alter the status of the several states as independent foreign sovereignties, each free to ignore obligations created under the laws or by the judicial proceedings of the others, and to make them integral parts of a single nation.”</p>
<p id="c0f93c41-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to judgments, “the full faith and credit obligation is exacting.” “A final judgment in one State, if rendered by a court with adjudicatory authority over the subject matter and persons governed by the judgment, qualifies for recognition throughout the land.” A State may not disregard the judgment of a sister State because it disagrees with the reasoning underlying the judgment or deems it to be wrong on the merits. On the contrary, “the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution precludes any inquiry into the merits of the cause of action, the logic or consistency of the decision, or the validity of the legal principles on which the judgment is based.”</p>
<p id="c0f93c42-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A State is not required, however, to afford full faith and credit to a judgment rendered by a court that “did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter or the relevant parties.” “Consequently, before a court is bound by [a] judgment rendered in another State, it may inquire into the jurisdictional basis of the foreign court’s decree.” That jurisdictional inquiry, however, is a limited one. “[I]f the judgment on its face appears to be a ‘record of a court of general jurisdiction, such jurisdiction over the cause and the parties is to be presumed unless disproved by extrinsic evidence, or by the record itself.’”</p>
<p id="c0f93c43-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="761" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-761">p. 761</span>Those principles resolve this case. Under Georgia law, as relevant here, “[t]he superior courts of the several counties shall have exclusive jurisdiction in all matters of adoption.” Ga. Code Ann. §19-8-2(a) (2015). That provision on its face gave the Georgia Superior Court subject-matter jurisdiction to hear and decide the adoption petition at issue here. The Superior Court resolved that matter by entering a final judgment that made V.L. the legal adoptive parent of the children. Whatever the merits of that judgment, it was within the statutory grant of jurisdiction over “all matters of adoption.” The Georgia court thus had the “adjudicatory authority over the subject matter” required to entitle its judgment to full faith and credit.</p>
<p id="c0f93c44-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Alabama Supreme Court reached a different result by relying on Ga. Code Ann. §19-8-5(a). That statute states (as relevant here) that “a child who has any living parent or guardian may be adopted by a third party. . . . only if each such living parent and each such guardian has voluntarily and in writing surrendered all of his or her rights to such child.” The Alabama Supreme Court concluded that this provision prohibited the Georgia Superior Court from allowing V.L. to adopt the children while also allowing E.L. to keep her existing parental rights. It further concluded that this provision went not to the merits but to the Georgia court’s subject-matter jurisdiction. . . . </p>
<p id="c0f93c45-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That analysis is not consistent with this Court’s controlling precedent. Where a judgment indicates on its face that it was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, such jurisdiction “is to be presumed unless disproved.” There is nothing here to rebut that presumption. The Georgia statute, on which the Alabama Supreme Court relied, does not speak in jurisdictional terms; for instance, it does not say that a Georgia court “shall have jurisdiction to enter an adoption decree” only if each existing parent or guardian has surrendered his or her parental rights. . . . </p>
<p id="c0f93c46-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 19-8-5(a) does not become jurisdictional just because it is “mandatory” and “must be strictly construed.” This Court “has long rejected the notion that all mandatory prescriptions, however emphatic, are properly typed jurisdictional.” Indeed, the Alabama Supreme Court’s reasoning would give jurisdictional status to <i>every</i> requirement of the Georgia adoption statutes, since Georgia law indicates those requirements are all mandatory and must be strictly construed. That result would comport neither with Georgia law nor with common sense.</p>
<p id="c0f93c47-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Justice Holmes observed more than a century ago, “it sometimes may be difficult to decide whether certain words in a statute are directed to jurisdiction or to merits.” In such cases, especially where the Full Faith and Credit Clause is concerned, a court must be “slow to read ambiguous words, as meaning to leave the judgment open to dispute, or as intended to do more than fix the rule by which the court should decide.” That time-honored rule controls here. The Georgia judgment appears on its face to have been issued by a court with jurisdiction, and there is no established Georgia law to the contrary. It follows that the Alabama Supreme Court erred in refusing to grant that judgment full faith and credit.</p>
<p id="c0f93c48-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The petition for writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment of the Alabama Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. <i>It is so ordered.</i></p>

Ironically, the choice of appealing in timely fashion the Georgia adoption decree through the Georgia appellate system was not realistically available to E.L., because at that time she was actually in support of the adoption decree.

General Motors Corp., 522 U.S. 222, 233 (1998). Apart from collateral attacks on jurisdiction and the reopening of judgments as discussed below, full faith and credit is due to sister-state judgments, period. In particular, the fact that the court in the first case may have made an obvious error—basing its decision on an incorrect reading of the facts, or misapplying the law governing the case—is not a basis for the courts of another state to deny full faith and credit to the judgment. This has been the rule at least since Justice Holmes’s opinion for the Court in Fauntleroy v. Lum, 210 U.S. 230 (1908), which is quoted briefly in <i>V.L. v. E.L.</i></p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0f96364-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i> establishes that a party over whom the court lacks personal jurisdiction, and who does not appear in the case, may collaterally challenge the resulting judgment. That proposition is still good law. After all, in the case of such a default judgment, the validity of personal jurisdiction was never explicitly found, and no defendant was there to raise the issue. The opposite proposition—that a party who appears and contests personal jurisdiction is bound by the court’s decision on the jurisdictional question—was decided in Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men’s Assn., 283 U.S. 522 (1931). So collateral attack is not available simply because the losing party disagrees with the first court’s decision on personal jurisdiction. If the first court explicitly found that it had jurisdiction over the defendant, that finding may not be relitigated.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0f96365-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Durfee v. Duke, 375 U.S. 106 (1963), the Supreme Court established the same basic principle when it is subject matter jurisdiction that was allegedly lacking in the first case: Lack of subject matter jurisdiction may, in principle, be a basis for collateral attack, but if the defendant has appeared in the first case and the court has actually found that it had subject matter jurisdiction, no collateral attack is available. It is worth noting that, whereas the U.S. Constitution itself holds that a judgment entered in the absence of constitutionally valid personal jurisdiction is void, the kinds of subject matter jurisdiction issues that arise in state court do not always raise such grandiose constitutional issues; often they simply concern state rules directing various types of litigation to different state courts or determining what kinds of remedies a court can issue. Thus, while state court judgments rendered without proper subject matter jurisdiction are not, as a general matter, entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of other states, that is not necessarily because the initial assertion of subject matter jurisdiction itself violated the Constitution.</p></li>

Suppose that the question a party sought to relitigate was an ordinary factual one: the date of a purported deed conveying land. If a court in State <i>A</i> had decided that question, ordinary preclusion doctrine would bar its relitigation in any subsequent action between the same parties. The Full Faith and Credit Clause (and 28 U.S.C. §1738) would require that the court of a sister state (or a federal court) give the same effect to that decided issue as a court in State <i>A</i>.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0f96367-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Armed with the knowledge that lack of jurisdiction in Case 1 is an exception to the full faith and credit obligation, E.L. simply tried to argue in the Alabama <span title="764" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-764">p. 764</span>courts (initially with some success) that the Georgia courts had lacked jurisdiction to enter the adoption decree. You can see that the U.S. Supreme Court did not buy the argument. The Georgia statute cited by E.L. (and allegedly ignored or wrongly applied by the Georgia court) was not one regulating the jurisdiction of the Georgia trial court; it was one that simply established the prerequisites for granting an adoption under the circumstances faced by V.L. and E.L. Given the prevailing doctrine of full faith and credit, losing parties will have an incentive to characterize laws that were allegedly improperly applied by the first court as <i>jurisdictional</i> in nature, even if such a characterization is dubious.</p>

Duke</i> one small step further, holding that one who appears and fails to challenge subject matter jurisdiction is bound by the resulting judgment, unless she can “rebut that presumption” that the court had jurisdiction. In other words, it is not necessary that the court explicitly rule that it had subject matter jurisdiction in order for its ruling on the merits to be entitled to full faith and credit; if the court proceeds to exercise such jurisdiction under a statute that appears to grant it that power, the validity of the first court’s jurisdiction will be presumed (unless the presumption can be rebutted) in any later collateral attack on the judgment. Thus, E.L. did technically have the opportunity in the Alabama case to collaterally challenge the Georgia courts’ subject matter jurisdiction, but the “rebuttable presumption” approach taken by the Supreme Court unquestionably set a high bar for E.L.</p></li>

General Motors Corp., 522 U.S. 222 (1998), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the courts in State <i>B</i> are not required by the Full Faith and Credit Clause or the federal statute to enforce according to its terms an injunction entered by a court in State <i>A</i>. Ronald Elwell, a former GM engineer who testified against GM in a Georgia state case, reached a settlement with GM in their ensuing legal dispute; that settlement included Elwell’s agreement to a permanent injunction barring Elwell from testifying against GM in other product liability cases. When Elwell nevertheless testified in such a case in a federal court in Missouri, GM sought interstate enforcement of the injunction. The Supreme Court held that full faith and credit did not require enforcement of the injunction by the federal court in Missouri: “Enforcement measures [such as injunctions] do not travel with the sister state judgment as preclusive effects do; such measures remain subject to the even-handed control of forum law.” Of course, the duty of enforcing sister-state money judgments remains firm.</p></li>

<p id="c0f96374-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Claim and issue preclusion combine with requirements of full faith and credit to force litigants and courts to honor judgments. In the great majority of cases, litigants wishing to challenge the correctness of a judgment must appeal the decision to a higher court rather than file a second lawsuit. This principle, intended to force <span title="766" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-766">p. 766</span>challenges into regular channels, can itself work injustice. Consider the case of a litigant who discovers that her opponent has won a victory by unlawful means: Perhaps he failed to serve her with process and thus obtained a default judgment; perhaps he concealed a crucial piece of evidence by failing to produce it in response to an appropriate discovery request. In such a case, appeal will not work because the original court committed no error; the complaint is instead about evidence that never reached the court’s attention. But if the plaintiff simply begins a second lawsuit, she will face the defense of claim preclusion.</p>
<p id="c0f96375-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The escape from this dilemma lies in the opportunity to reopen a judgment. See Rule 60(b). We approach this subject carefully because any discussion of it tends to overstate its practical availability. The basic mechanisms for correcting errors are post-trial motions in the trial court and appeals. To the extent that another post-judgment remedy is available, it necessarily undercuts the appellate system. For this reason, courts insist repeatedly that relief under Rule 60(b) is not a substitute for appeal.</p>
<p id="c0f96376-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Scan Rule 60(b) and note the different grounds for which relief may be granted. Consider its effort to define the line between interests in finality of adjudication and the inclination to correct injustices when they occur. Now consider what should happen, under Rule 60, if, after a final judgment, the losing litigant discovers that the opposition has failed during discovery to produce highly relevant, perhaps dispositive, materials in its possession. Compare your intuition to the results of the next case.</p>

If so, it would belong to Beggerly, and the United States would have to purchase it; if not, the U.S. government would already own it. That case settled on the eve of trial for a relatively modest sum, reflecting the uncertainty of Beggerly’s title.] Judgment was entered based on this settlement agreement. In 1994, some 12 years after that judgment, respondents sued in the District Court to set aside the settlement agreement and obtain a damage award for the disputed land. . . . </p>

Government officials searched public land records and told respondents that they had found nothing proving that any part of Horn Island had ever been granted to a private landowner. Even after the settlement in the <i>Adams</i> litigation, however, respondents continued to search for evidence of a land patent that supported their claim of title. In 1991 they hired a genealogical record specialist to conduct research in the National Archives in Washington.

<p id="c0f98a91-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think the Government’s position is inconsistent with the history and language of Rule 60(b).

The Advisory Committee notes confirmed this, indicating that “if the right to make a motion is lost by the expiration of the time limits fixed in these rules, the only other procedural remedy is by a new or independent action to set aside a judgment upon those principles which have heretofore been applied in such an action.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0f98a94-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government is therefore wrong to suggest that an independent action brought in the same court as the original lawsuit requires an independent basis for jurisdiction. This is not to say, however, that the requirements for a meritorious independent action have been met here.

Whether such a claim might succeed under Rule 60(b)(3) we need not now decide; it surely would work no “grave miscarriage of justice,” and perhaps no miscarriage of justice at all, to allow the judgment to stand.

Perhaps as a consequence, although the Rule itself does not make any distinction between judgments entered at different stages of the litigative process, the courts have in practice made a very sharp distinction between default judgments and others. The effect has been to make it comparatively easy to open a default judgment <span title="770" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-770">p. 770</span>on the showing of some negligence and meritorious defense. (See <i>Peralta</i>, supra page 525, for an example.) Numerous decisions state, in one way or another, a very strong policy against judgments without consideration of the merits. Indeed, this policy is so strong that some practitioners advise against taking a default judgment unless there is absolutely no alternative. These lawyers have seen too many default judgments taken and defended in clear and justifiable circumstances, only to be set aside in the trial court or on appeal. The net result is considerable expense and a multiyear delay in the litigation.</p></li>

<p id="c0fa0002-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q1.</b> B and C are correct. A is wrong because claim preclusion requires a judgment, and a settlement is not a judgment—and thus B is correct. C is correct because, if the release was properly drafted, GrowCo can plead it as an affirmative defense and bar Jane’s second suit.</p>
<p id="c0fa0003-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q2.</b> A is correct. Because there was an answer (which is a “pleading”—see Rule 7), Rule 13(a) comes into play. Because Jane’s complaint alleged claims surrounding intellectual property in new plant strains, most courts would find that GrowCo’s claim concerning trade secrets involved the same transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences—and was therefore a compulsory counterclaim, waived when omitted from the answer.</p>
<p id="c0fa0004-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q3.</b> B is correct. The civil case determined only that it was more likely than not that Student committed fraud. The issue in the criminal case will be whether a fact-finder can conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that fraud was committed—a different issue.</p>
<p id="c0fa0005-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4.</b> Only A is correct. A is correct because federal courts not sitting in diversity attach broad preclusive effect to 12(b)(6) dismissals—precluding not only the claim brought but transactionally related claims that could be brought. (Here the state law claim could have come into federal court under supplemental jurisdiction.) The second court—state or federal—must give the federal judgment the scope the rendering court would give it. B is wrong because a state court is bound to give the federal judgment the same preclusive effect as the court that rendered it. C is wrong because a 12(b)(6) motion addresses only whether the complaint states a claim.</p>
<p id="c0fa0006-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q5.</b> A is the correct response. Borrower <i>B</i> can bring her claim because she has not had an opportunity to present her claim. B is wrong because the first lawsuit established only that Borrower <i>A</i> did not so persuade the court; Borrower <i>B</i> is entitled to her own day in court.</p>
<p id="c0fa0007-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="773" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-773">p. 773</span><b>Q6.</b> B and C are correct. A is wrong because Borrower <i>B</i> has a right to bring his own claim; there is no requirement of joinder. B is correct for the reason just stated. C is correct because federal courts have allowed nonmutual issue preclusion; so long as Lender’s opportunity and incentive to litigate were similar in the first and second suits, and Borrower <i>B</i> could not have joined Borrower <i>A</i>’s suit, preclusion on this issue will apply.</p>
<p id="c0fa0008-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q7.</b> D is the only correct response. A is wrong because although Frier’s due process claim might be precluded (as the court held), Roommate’s isn’t. B is wrong because Lawsuit #1 established only whether Frier was entitled to get his car back. C is wrong because Frier’s entitlement to get his car back will have no bearing on whether the City violated due process.</p>
<p id="c0fa0009-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q8.</b> Only A is correct. The court’s decision in Frier’s case will have precedential effect (whether that effect is binding or only persuasive will depend on what court issued the ruling). B is wrong because the ability to join Frier’s claim is not sufficient to warrant claim preclusion (see <i>Taylor v. Sturgell</i>). C is wrong because issue preclusion cannot be asserted against one not a party to the prior suit.</p>

After the railroad wins the first 25 suits, a plaintiff wins in suit 26.

Indeed, differences in available procedures may sometimes justify not allowing a prior judgment to have estoppel effect in a subsequent action even between the same parties, or where defensive estoppel is asserted against a plaintiff who has litigated and lost. The problem of unfairness is particularly acute in cases of offensive estoppel, however, because the defendant against whom estoppel is asserted typically will not have chosen the forum in the first action.
