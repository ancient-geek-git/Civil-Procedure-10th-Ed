<p id="c0a417fe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In studying the procedural system used in U.S. courts you can take at least two different paths. One path starts from the bottom, examining the way in which an individual lawsuit develops: how the parties state cases, develop information about them, and bring them to resolution. This approach emphasizes features and problems of the contemporary procedural system, which is in many respects a bold experiment. Studying the process of litigation reveals how these features shape and constrain the litigants’ responsibilities and choices. The other path starts from the top, examining the constitutional environment in which the individual lawsuit exists. That approach takes you into both the history and the current interpretation of the Constitution of the United States. Studying that document reveals several limits on the ways in which state and federal court systems conduct their business, limits that have major consequences for individual litigants.</p>
<p id="c0a417ff-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Anyone wanting to become a lawyer has to understand both approaches, comprehending the constitutional environment as well as the modes for processing disputes. This book accordingly contains materials about both, and most courses will examine both. But a course can with equal validity start at the top and work down or begin at the bottom and work up. The three parts of this book are labeled to emphasize those different starting points. Some courses may begin with this section, Part II: The Process of Litigation, comprising Chapters 5-11 and representing the <span title="290" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-290">p. 290</span>"bottom-up" approach. Other classes may start with Part I: The Constitutional Framework for U.S. Litigation, comprising Chapters 2-4, the "top-down" approach.</p>
<p id="c0a43f10-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third part of this book, Part III: Probing the Boundaries: Additional Claims and Parties, combines significant elements of both of the other parts and may be studied either at the end of the course, as a reprise, or in conjunction with either of the other two parts.</p>

<div id="c0a43f11-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" level="A" class="epub-section epub-ahead cc-section"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-xlarge left"><h2><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0a43f12-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">B.&nbsp;CHOOSING PROCEDURE</p></h2></div>


<p id="c0a43f13-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since disputing began (which, according to several religious traditions, was shortly after the first humans appeared on the face of the Earth), disputants and whoever helped them resolve their disputes have been faced with procedural choices. One way of framing the choices is as between speed and quality. Everyone wants disputes to be decided quickly; everyone also wants them to be decided correctly—after full exploration of the facts and careful weighing of the law. But even in a world of unlimited resources these two goals conflict, and we have limited resources. Another way to frame the conflict is as between fairness and justice. Everyone wants the judge to be fair as between the parties; everyone also wants the judge to decide in favor of the party on whose side truth lies. But in some cases these goals will conflict; the side with the best presentation may not be the side where truth resides.</p>
<p id="c0a43f14-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These conflicts force those who design procedure (legislators, lawyers, judges) to choose; moreover, they must choose not just once but at every stage of the process. Should all cases go to trial—on the ground that trials may best uncover the truth—or should we weed out most cases before trial, thus speeding the resolution of disputes while increasing the risk of error? Should plaintiffs at the outset have to state their cases in detail—to sort weak from strong cases at an early stage—or would a requirement of detailed pleading trip up plaintiffs with good cases who need access to facts known only to the defendant? How much post-filing factual investigation should we permit, bearing in mind that greater access will turn up more information but also increase cost and delay? How much autonomy should we give to the parties—which will require fewer judges and less public expense—and how much should we insist on judicial responsibility—which may increase public confidence in the outcome but will increase public cost?</p>
<p id="c0a43f15-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Behind these questions lies another, more generalized issue: Is a lawsuit a quest for truth, or a way to settle a dispute? The more we think litigation is an inquiry into truth, the more likely we are to want judges rather than the adversaries to control the inquiry. The more confident we are that litigation reveals the truth, the more likely we are to think it proper to apply the findings of one judge or jury to similar lawsuits. Conversely, the more we see litigation as a battle between the parties, the greater our comfort with giving the parties control over the terms of that battle, but the less we’ll be inclined to think that the personalized battle yields truth.</p>
<p id="c0a43f16-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These and similar questions lie just beneath the surface of contemporary procedural rules: Each rule, and often even innocuous-looking individual words and <span title="291" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-291">p. 291</span>phrases within the rules, represents a choice among procedural values. In exploring the development of a lawsuit, we shall be doing at least three things: seeing how a procedural system has made particular choices; seeing how judges and other lawmakers can have second thoughts about those choices; and looking beneath those choices at the values they imply. That exploration is particularly apt because the procedural system we shall explore—that set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure—represents a self-conscious choice of flexibility. The drafters of the Rules (and those who have since amended them) sought above all to break free from what they thought were rigidities of earlier procedural systems. They largely succeeded, but critics have begun to ask whether as a result lawsuits have become unstructured, expensive monsters.</p>

<p id="c0a43f19-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This book explores the answers to such questions by following the development of a lawsuit in roughly chronological order. Chapter 5 looks at why people litigate by exploring the demography of contemporary litigation, the arsenal of remedies courts can grant, and how litigation is financed. Chapter 6—on pleading—explores how lawsuits are commenced. At the commencement of the lawsuit a lawyer must decide whether to join additional claims and parties; for teaching purposes one can explore this question in one of two ways. One approach moves from pleading (the setting forth of claims) to the exploration of facts underlying those claims—that is discovery, explored in Chapter 7. The other approach explores how lawyers join additional parties and additional claims to a lawsuit, the topic of Chapter 12, before examining discovery.</p>
<p id="c0a43f1a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most lawsuits reach the discovery stage; the real question is whether they will go further. Chapter 8 examines a variety of official and unofficial ways in which lawsuits can end during or shortly after the discovery period. If they do not end then, they proceed to trial. Chapter 9 examines who will decide the issues in a lawsuit and what principles limit their freedom of decision. Once the trial is over, the loser may appeal; Chapter 10 examines the availability of and limits on appeals. Whether a lawsuit ends on appeal or at some earlier stage, there may come a quite difficult question: Just what is it that the now-concluded lawsuit has decided? That question, which goes under several doctrinal names, is explored in Chapter 11, Respect for Judgments.</p>
