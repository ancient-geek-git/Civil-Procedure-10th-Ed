<div class="cc-section epub-section epub-anyhead" id="c0deaf8a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">
<p id="c0ded69b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now come to the only part of civil procedure about which you thought you knew something before starting law school. Trials are a familiar part of our general social knowledge. They have been the stuff of drama for centuries, and of the scriptures of several religious traditions for millennia. In this tradition, trial, the culminating moment of every lawsuit, brings truth to light as witnesses blurt out surprising statements, or juries do justice in the face of apparently overwhelming adverse evidence. And when the verdict arrives, the case is over: Victors beam, losers slink away.</p>
<p id="c0ded69c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unfortunately, most of that knowledge turns out to be wrong. First: Despite the ubiquity of trials in books and movies, there are at present very few trials in real life. As you have already gathered from earlier chapters, in the federal courts fewer than 2 percent of civil cases reach this point; in state courts the proportion is somewhat higher, but still small. Second, when civil cases do get to trial, they look very little like the edge-of-the-seat versions you read about and watch. Instead, there are few surprises and little drama, at least if lawyers have conducted appropriate discovery. In well-prepared civil litigation both sides will know what every witness or document will say, and if a witness’s testimony varies from that given in deposition, he will be promptly impeached with prior sworn testimony. Dramatic revelations, if they occur, may even provide the basis for a new trial, at least if the information disclosed at trial was sought by one of the parties but not revealed in discovery. The parties may not know how the case will be decided, but they will know well the conflicting versions of the story. This phase of litigation differs from popular <span title="594" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-594">p. 594</span>depictions for a third reason: Trial is not the end of the saga, or at least not always. As we will see in the next chapter, there may well be an appeal, but even if there is not, there will certainly be post-verdict motions for judgment as a matter of law or, alternatively, for a new trial.</p>
<p id="c0ded69d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why, then, study a rare and usually dull intermediate stage of civil litigation? First, trials, rare though they have come to be, shape almost every aspect of procedure. The elaborate provisions for discovery have as one of their primary goals the uncovering of information to be presented at trial. Much of the law of evidence is aimed at controlling the flow of information during trial. Likewise, the emphasis on the presentation of live witnesses (rather than depositions or other documentary evidence)—which brings with it the opportunity for theatrical displays by lawyers—stems from a conception of the trial as the culmination of litigation. Even the adversarial stance of the lawyers—perhaps more marked in Anglo-American law than in other systems—may flow in part from the realization that the whole case rides on a single presentation in a comparatively short time span before a judge or jury.</p>
<p id="c0ded69e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, although trials do not display the kind of drama that you have come to expect, there is, nevertheless, a certain kind of drama in trials. But the drama goes on behind the scenes, as the parties battle over which judge and which jurors should be allowed to decide the case, what they should be allowed to hear, and whether the judge’s or jurors’ decision should be allowed to stand. This chapter goes behind the scenes to examine the actors in these concealed struggles for power that can make all the difference in the outcome of the case.</p>
<p id="c0ded69f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This chapter will tackle the topic by asking (and answering) just two questions: <i>Who</i> will decide the case? (Sections A and B, dealing with choosing judges and juries); and <i>How</i> will they decide the case? (Sections C-G, about the procedures that shape trial). We begin with who.</p>
</div>
<div id="c0ded6a0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" level="A" class="epub-section epub-ahead cc-section"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-xlarge left"><h2><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0ded6a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">A.&nbsp;CHOOSING AND CHALLENGING JUDGES</p></h2></div>


<p id="c0ded6a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether or not there will be a jury in your case, there will be a judge. That judge may rule on whether you are entitled to a jury. And if you are entitled to a jury, that judge will rule on your challenges to the jury pool and individual jurors. And long before you get to the trial stage, that judge—in almost all federal courts and in many state courts—will have likely ruled on various aspects of the litigation, from the sufficiency of pleadings to motions to dismiss to discovery disputes and summary judgment motions. So a great deal turns on the wisdom, knowledge, fairness, and diligence of the judge. Litigators will tell you that, next to the merits of the case, the identity of the judge is the most important factor in predicting the outcome of the case.</p>
<p id="c0ded6a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How do judges get to be judges? Broadly speaking, they get to their offices in one of two ways: by appointment or by election. Federal judges are nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate; once appointed they can be removed only by impeachment. Most state judges owe their initial place on the <span title="595" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-595">p. 595</span>bench to gubernatorial appointment. Thereafter they are subject to occasional electoral exposure, sometimes by facing a challenge in a reconfirmation election. A minority of state judges will first take the bench as a winner of an electoral contest. These elections are usually nonpartisan, but in some states judges run as candidates of a given political party. Both the appointive and the electoral process leave their imprints.</p>
<p id="c0ded6a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Let’s start with the imprint of a President, governor, or other appointing authority. Though these executives may have run on a platform promising to appoint judges of a certain cast of mind, all will want to appoint judges who will not embarrass them. That means a very thorough background check, which will be devoted partly to ascertaining the skill, professional standing, and reputation of the nominee, and partly to looking into nooks and crannies of her past with an eye to discovering anything that might block her confirmation or cast the appointing authority in a bad light. Electoral contests may also turn up such information—and may pressure the judicial candidate to take positions on issues of concern to the voters. If the judge has to face voters in a reconfirmation election, she may also be wary about rulings that will be unpopular or easily mischaracterized by opponents. That is not to say that judges will not make such rulings—they do every day—but it is to say that the consequences of such a ruling may lurk in the back of the judicial mind.</p>
<p id="c0ded6a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beyond these features lie those of background. Almost all judges will be trained as lawyers; only a few states do not require lower judicial officers (magistrates or justices of the peace) to have legal training. Judges will thus bring with them to the bench all the knowledge and habits of thought such training implies; even at this early stage of your career you are likely learning that lawyers think about many matters differently than nonlawyers. And because they have half a career as lawyers behind them, judges will not likely have had significant experience in ballet dancing, heavy construction, cab-driving, or elementary school teaching and therefore lack the knowledge and sense of the world that each of these occupations might bring. Moreover, they are distinguished even from the million or so people in the United States who are licensed to practice law: They belong to the subset of about 20,000 who hold judicial offices.</p>
<p id="c0ded6a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such professional training helps keep judges focused on factors the law defines as legally relevant, but judges are human, and humans are fallible. How does the system seek to protect litigants against biased judges? There are two answers to that question: judicial discipline and recusal.</p>
<p id="c0ded6a7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most states and the federal judiciary have procedures for disciplining judges who, though unbiased, fail to comply with the Judicial Canons of Ethics. States have various mechanisms for receiving, investigating, and acting upon complaints against state judges. In the federal judiciary, 28 U.S.C. §§351 et seq. permits persons to file complaints against judges, and requires the chief judge of each circuit to investigate the charges and to take various actions—including dismissal of the complaint, a declaration that the judge in question is disabled, censure or reprimand, and referral of the case to the House of Representatives for impeachment proceedings. But violation of the Canons, while perhaps cause for complaint and discipline against a judge, does not remove that judge from your particular case. Only recusal does that.</p>
<p id="c0defdb8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="596" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-596">p. 596</span>There are two forms of recusal: peremptory and for cause. About a third of the states, mostly midwestern and western, permit peremptory challenges of judges. A party wishing to make such a challenge simply files a timely affidavit alleging in conclusory terms that the judge is prejudiced against the party. James Sample, David Posen &amp; Michael Young, Fair Courts: Setting Recusal Standards 8 (Brennan Center for Justice 2008). Actual prejudice need not be shown, but each side gets only one such challenge. The words of one federal statute, 28 U.S.C. §144, appear to require peremptory recusal in the federal courts,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10066_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10066_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*1</a></span> but the Supreme Court has interpreted that statute to require cause.</p>
<p id="c0defdba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What cause might look like is defined in 28 U.S.C. §455, which closely tracks the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, a code likewise echoed by most state recusal statutes. Section 455 establishes two broad categories for disqualifying a judge. One contains specific guidelines barring, for example, a judge’s hearing a case “where he has served as lawyer in the matter in controversy” before becoming a judge or “[w]here he has served in governmental employment and. . . . expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case or controversy.” It also bars decisions in cases in which a judge or her family has a financial interest. 28 U.S.C. §455(b). The other category is much broader: “Any justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” 28 U.S.C. §455(a). As a build-up to the case law, use the following problems to familiarize yourself with the statute.</p>

Five justices heard the case, and the vote to reverse was 3 to 2.

The §527 organization opposed McGraw and supported Benjamin. Blankenship’s donations accounted for more than two-thirds of the total funds it raised. This was not all.

He also delivered an opinion stating] that he [had] “carefully considered the bases and accompanying exhibits proffered by the movants.” But he found “no objective information. . . . to <span title="599" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-599">p. 599</span>show that this Justice has a bias for or against any litigant, that this Justice has prejudged the matters which comprise this litigation, or that this Justice will be anything but fair and impartial”. . . . [and] that he had no “’direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest’ in this case.” Adopting “a standard merely of ’appearances,’” he concluded, “seems little more than an invitation to subject West Virginia’s justice system to the vagaries of the day—a framework in which predictability and stability yield to supposition, innuendo, half-truths, and partisan manipulations.”</p>

<p id="c0df4bf6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is axiomatic that “[a] fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.” As the Court has recognized, however, “most matters relating to judicial disqualification [do] not rise to a constitutional level.” The early and leading case on the subject is Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510 (1927). There, the Court stated that “matters of kinship, personal bias, state policy, remoteness of interest, would seem generally to be matters merely of legislative discretion.”</p>
<p id="c0df4bf7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Tumey</i> Court concluded that the Due Process Clause incorporated the common-law rule that a judge must recuse himself when he has “a direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest” in a case. This rule reflects the maxim that “[n]o man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause; because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0df4bf8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As new problems have emerged that were not discussed at common law, however, the Court has identified additional instances which, as an objective matter, require recusal. These are circumstances “in which experience teaches that the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.” To place the present case in proper context, two instances where the Court has required recusal merit further discussion.</p>

<p id="c0df4bfa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first involved the emergence of local tribunals where a judge had a financial interest in the outcome of a case, although the interest was less than what would have been considered personal or direct at common law.</p>
<p id="c0df4bfb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This was the problem addressed in <i>Tumey</i>. There, the mayor of a village had the authority to sit as a judge (with no jury) to try those accused of violating a state law prohibiting the possession of alcoholic beverages. Inherent in this structure were two potential conflicts. First, the mayor received a salary supplement for performing judicial duties, and the funds for that compensation derived from the fines assessed in a case. No fines were assessed upon acquittal. The mayor-judge thus received a salary supplement only if he convicted the defendant. Second, sums from the criminal fines were deposited to the village’s general treasury fund for village improvements and repairs.</p>
<p id="c0df4bfc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court held that the Due Process Clause required disqualification. . . . </p>
<p id="c0df4bfd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This concern with conflicts resulting from financial incentives was elaborated in Ward v. Monroeville, 409 U.S. 57 (1972), which invalidated a conviction in another mayor’s court. In <i>Monroeville</i>, unlike in <i>Tumey</i>, the mayor received no money; instead, <span title="600" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-600">p. 600</span>the fines the mayor assessed went to the town’s general fisc. The Court held that “[t]he fact that the mayor [in <i>Tumey</i>] shared directly in the fees and costs did not define the limits of the principle.” The principle, instead, turned on the “’possible temptation’” the mayor might face; the mayor’s “executive responsibilities for village finances may make him partisan to maintain the high level of contribution [to those finances] from the mayor’s court.” As the Court reiterated in another case that Term, “the [judge’s] financial stake need not be as direct or positive as it appeared to be in <i>Tumey</i>.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0df4bfe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In another case] the Court stressed that it was “not required to decide whether in fact [the justice] was influenced.” The proper constitutional inquiry is “whether sitting on the case then before the Supreme Court of Alabama “would offer a possible temptation to the average. . . . judge to. . . . lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true.” The Court underscored that “what degree or kind of interest is sufficient to disqualify a judge from sitting ’cannot be defined with precision.’” In the Court’s view, however, it was important that the test have an objective component.</p>

<p id="c0df4c00-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second instance requiring recusal that was not discussed at common law emerged in the criminal contempt context, where a judge had no pecuniary interest in the case but was challenged because of a conflict arising from his participation in an earlier proceeding. This Court characterized that first proceeding (perhaps pejoratively) as a “’one-man grand jury.’”</p>
<p id="c0df4c01-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In that first proceeding, and as provided by state law, a judge examined witnesses to determine whether criminal charges should be brought. The judge called the two petitioners before him. One petitioner answered questions, but the judge found him untruthful and charged him with perjury. The second declined to answer on the ground that he did not have counsel with him, as state law seemed to permit. The judge charged him with contempt. The judge proceeded to try and convict both petitioners.</p>
<p id="c0df7312-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court set aside the convictions on grounds that the judge had a conflict of interest at the trial stage because of his earlier participation followed by his decision to charge them. The Due Process Clause required disqualification. The Court recited the general rule that “no man can be a judge in his own case,” adding that “no man is permitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome.” It noted that the disqualifying criteria “cannot be defined with precision. Circumstances and relationships must be considered.” These circumstances and the prior relationship required recusal: “Having been a part of [the one-man grand jury] process a judge cannot be, in the very nature of things, wholly disinterested in the conviction or acquittal of those accused.” That is because “[a]s a practical matter it is difficult if not impossible for a judge to free himself from the influence of what took place in his ’grand-jury’ secret session.”  . . . </p>

<p id="c0df7314-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on the principles described in these cases we turn to the issue before us. This problem arises in the context of judicial elections, a framework not presented in the precedents we have reviewed and discussed.</p>
<p id="c0df7315-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="601" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-601">p. 601</span>Caperton contends that Blankenship’s pivotal role in getting Justice Benjamin elected created a constitutionally intolerable probability of actual bias. Though not a bribe or criminal influence, Justice Benjamin would nevertheless feel a debt of gratitude to Blankenship for his extraordinary efforts to get him elected. That temptation, Caperton claims, is as strong and inherent in human nature as was the conflict the Court confronted. . . . when a mayor-judge (or the city) benefited financially from a defendant’s conviction, as well as the conflict identified. . . . when a judge was the object of a defendant’s contempt.</p>
<p id="c0df7316-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Benjamin was careful to address the recusal motions and explain his reasons why, on his view of the controlling standard, disqualification was not in order. In four separate opinions issued during the course of the appeal, he explained why no actual bias had been established. He found no basis for recusal because Caperton failed to provide “objective evidence” or “objective information,” but merely “subjective belief” of bias. Nor could anyone “point to any actual conduct or activity on [his] part which could be termed ’improper.’” In other words, based on the facts presented by Caperton, Justice Benjamin conducted a probing search into his actual motives and inclinations; and he found none to be improper. We do not question his subjective findings of impartiality and propriety. Nor do we determine whether there was actual bias. . . . </p>
<p id="c0df7317-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difficulties of inquiring into actual bias, and the fact that the inquiry is often a private one, simply underscore the need for objective rules. Otherwise there may be no adequate protection against a judge who simply misreads or misapprehends the real motives at work in deciding the case. The judge’s own inquiry into actual bias, then, is not one that the law can easily superintend or review, though actual bias, if disclosed, no doubt would be grounds for appropriate relief. In lieu of exclusive reliance on that personal inquiry, or on appellate review of the judge’s determination respecting actual bias, the Due Process Clause has been implemented by objective standards that do not require proof of actual bias. In defining these standards the Court has asked whether, “under a realistic appraisal of psychological tendencies and human weakness,” the interest “poses such a risk of actual bias or prejudgment that the practice must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented.”</p>
<p id="c0df7318-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn to the influence at issue in this case. Not every campaign contribution by a litigant or attorney creates a probability of bias that requires a judge’s recusal, but this is an exceptional case. We conclude that there is a serious risk of actual bias—based on objective and reasonable perceptions—when a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds or directing the judge’s election campaign when the case was pending or imminent. The inquiry centers on the contribution’s relative size in comparison to the total amount of money contributed to the campaign, the total amount spent in the election, and the apparent effect such contribution had on the outcome of the election. . . . </p>
<p id="c0df7319-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether Blankenship’s campaign contributions were a necessary and sufficient cause of Benjamin’s victory is not the proper inquiry. Much like determining whether a judge is actually biased, proving what ultimately drives the electorate to choose a particular candidate is a difficult endeavor, not likely to lend itself to a certain <span title="602" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-602">p. 602</span>conclusion. This is particularly true where, as here, there is no procedure for judicial factfinding and the sole trier of fact is the one accused of bias. Due process requires an objective inquiry into whether the contributor’s influence on the election under all the circumstances “would offer a possible temptation to the average. . . . judge to. . . . lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true.” . . . </p>
<p id="c0df731a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Benjamin did undertake an extensive search for actual bias. But, as we have indicated, that is just one step in the judicial process; objective standards may also require recusal whether or not actual bias exists or can be proved. Due process “may sometimes bar trial by judges who have no actual bias and who would do their very best to weigh the scales of justice equally between contending parties.” The failure to consider objective standards requiring recusal is not consistent with the imperatives of due process. We find that Blankenship’s significant and disproportionate influence—coupled with the temporal relationship between the election and the pending case—"offer a possible temptation to the average. . . . judge to. . . . lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true.” On these extreme facts the probability of actual bias rises to an unconstitutional level.</p>

Thirty-two years later, Ronald Castille had been elected to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, when Williams’s post-conviction appeal came before that tribunal. The substantive issue was whether one of Castille’s prosecutors had improperly withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense.

The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-3 decision (a seat was vacant) reversed, citing <i>Caperton</i> for the proposition that because Justice Castille had a “significant, personal involvement” in the underlying case, due process compelled him to recuse himself.</p></li>

If the judge’s ruling creates a final judgment, the loser can appeal. If it does not, the loser can reconsider settlement (now at a less attractive value) or hunker down to wait for the end. With a jury, matters are different: There is now another source of power in the room, a source to whom both parties can speak. They can speak only of certain matters and only in certain ways, matters and ways the judge controls. But the existence of the jury changes everything—from lawyers’ propensity to speak in jargon and shorthand, to their calculations of ultimate success. Experienced lawyers will say that some cases are winnable only with a jury. Good empirical research tells us, however, that juries are not pushovers, and judges not stern deniers: Plaintiffs prevail in only half of the tort cases that go to a jury trial, and in some cases judges are more likely than juries to award high damages.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102C3_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N102C3_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*2</a></span></p>

Although we inherited the institution from English law, it is available there only in a few specialized cases (for example, in libel actions). But in the United States, civil jury trials are widely available in both state and federal courts. This availability results from provisions in state and the federal Constitutions granting the right to jury trial in certain cases. We will focus on the federal courts. In the debates attending the adoption of the federal Constitution in 1789 and the Bill of Rights in 1791, much attention was paid to the jury trial. Some opponents of the Constitution cited the omission of a civil jury trial provision (in the Constitution as it existed before the Bill of Rights) as an argument for not ratifying that document:</p>

They did not win the war, however, because the Amendment did not make all cases triable to a jury. Instead, it compromised between those who thought jury trial at best a nuisance, at worst an invitation to lawlessness, and those who thought it a vital structural and substantive principle of government. The compromise is embedded in the deceptively short text of the Seventh Amendment:<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10302_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10302_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*3</a></span></p>

<p id="c0e036a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts and lawyers typically divide the Amendment into two roughly equal halves: the “right to jury trial” clause, comprising the text up through the word “preserved”; and the “reexamination” clause, comprising the rest of the Amendment. Both parts empower and limit the civil jury. We begin with the part of the Amendment granting the right to a civil jury.</p>
<p id="c0e036a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first part of the Seventh Amendment reflects the great compromise in two phrases: “suits at common law” and “shall be preserved.” The Seventh Amendment purports to “preserve” a right but does not indicate the scope of the right being preserved. The English judicial system, whose organization was echoed by colonial courts in the period immediately before the Revolution, was divided into several jurisdictions. In courts of common law, jury trial was widely available on most of the writs commonly in use by the eighteenth century. A full list is not possible here, <span title="608" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-608">p. 608</span>but some of the more common writs will give the student a flavor: trespass (with several subcategories); debt (to recover sums owed); covenant (to remedy breaches of written, sealed contracts); ejectment (to recover land unlawfully occupied); trover and replevin (to recover for unlawful takings of personal property); and assumpsit (meaning “he (or she) promised,” to recover for breaches of informal, usually oral, contracts).</p>
<p id="c0e036a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In courts of chancery (which oversaw some important substantive areas, e.g., the law of trusts, and also administered various equitable remedies, e.g., injunctions), however, the judge (the chancellor) sat without a jury. The constitutional compromise, then, “preserved” as triable to a jury those cases that could have been brought in a court of common law. If, however, the claim would have fallen into the jurisdiction of the court of chancery, the Seventh Amendment did not extend the right to jury trial. Courts dealing with this issue distinguish between legal and equitable claims and remedies. By doing so, they are simply using a shorthand form of reference: “Legal” in this context means a claim recognized by a court of law (where juries sat), and “equitable” means that the claim or remedy would have been in chancery (where no juries sat).</p>
<p id="c0e036a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Chapter 5, we noted the development of elaborate doctrine concerning which cases could be brought in equity. The result was that equity had exclusive jurisdiction over some substantive areas (trusts are a good example) and shared jurisdiction when plaintiffs sought remedies such as injunctions, specific performance, rescission, and accountings and procedural devices such as derivative suits, class actions, bills of peace, and bills of interpleader. A given plaintiff had to show either that equity had exclusive jurisdiction over, say, the law of trusts, or that the traditional legal remedy of money damages was inadequate and that plaintiff otherwise qualified for equitable relief. See <i>Lucy Webb Hayes Natl. Training School v. Geoghegan</i>, in Chapter 5 (page 308) for an example of a court administering an equitable remedy (injunction) on a common law claim (trespass).</p>
<p id="c0e036a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Remember: Cases within equity jurisdiction did not wind up there because of anyone’s conviction that the judge was better suited than a jury to decide a particular type of claim. Although the judge may have been more qualified to sort out fiduciary relationships, probate matters, or multiparty actions, many other branches of equity jurisdiction involved the same questions of fact—what happened, how it happened, and who was telling the truth—as legal actions. For example, injunctive actions frequently involved questions of land ownership or commission of a tort, and specific performance claims usually involved the construction and meaning of contracts. Moreover, as time went on, distinctions between the two jurisdictions blurred even further: Legal claims in general assumpsit (money had and received) tended to parallel equitable remedies for restitution, and traditionally equitable defenses such as fraud, duress, and illegality came to be recognized at law. As a result, the law-equity jurisdictional distinction was far from hard and fast, and whatever distinction existed was more a result of history than of logic or function.</p>
<p id="c0e036a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the constitutional language “preserving” the right to a jury trial for suits at “common law,” it is not surprising that the courts have adopted a historical test for deciding the right to jury trial under the Seventh Amendment. Under the historical test, courts seek to give parties the same right of jury trial as they had in <span title="609" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-609">p. 609</span>1791. Presumably, the drafters of the Seventh Amendment were thinking of a world in which there were separate courts of law and equity, a world in which one could only “preserve” a right to jury trial in suits at common law. Because there had never been a right to jury trial in equity, there was nothing to preserve and no right to jury trial.</p>
<p id="c0e036a7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consequently, courts applying the historical test do not directly inquire about jury trial. Instead, they ask a related question: whether a given claim and remedy lay within the jurisdiction of the common law courts in 1791. If so, the parties have the right to a jury; if not—if only a court of equity would have heard the claim or administered that remedy—there is no right to a jury. Equitable jurisdiction generally turned on whether the plaintiff wanted injunctive or other relief available only in equity, wanted to use a procedural device that was available only in equity, or had a claim that could be brought only in equity. Before you despair of sorting all this out, be comforted by the thought that a very large portion of claims fit neatly into well-established historical patterns. Having mastered that pattern, you will have answers for the great majority of jury trial questions you will ever encounter.</p>
<p id="c0e036a8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, note that the U.S. Supreme Court has never held that the Seventh Amendment applies to the states—which are therefore free to decide the right to jury trial in civil cases without recourse to the U.S. Constitution.</p>

In a series of cases the Supreme Court has said that when facing such a case, the court should first try to locate the closest historical analogy. Thus, in a case involving union members’ right to fair representation by their union—a claim that could not have existed in 1791 because unions were illegal—the Court examined analogies to a malpractice action against one’s lawyer (which would have been a legal claim triable to a jury), a motion to vacate an arbitration order (equitable; no jury), and an action by the beneficiary of a trust against the trustee for breach of fiduciary duty (equitable; no jury). Chauffeurs, Teamsters, &amp; Helpers, Local No. 391 v. Terry, 494 U.S. 558 (1990). Finding no analogy close enough to satisfy it entirely, the majority then took a second, tie-breaking step, to look at the remedy sought in the case, money damages, and decided that it most resembled the remedy typical in legal claims triable to a jury, and that a jury was thus required. A concurring opinion complained that the Court was not at its best when “rattling through the dusty attics of ancient writs.” A dissent, by contrast, thought that the Court had discovered just the right analogue in that attic (the suit by the beneficiary of a trust) and that the Court should have stopped there and denied a jury trial. Again, recall that for the vast majority of claims the question of the right to trial by jury will be well established either in federal courts, which apply the Seventh Amendment, or in state courts, which apply their own constitutions and statutes.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0e05dc6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many instances, state courts have proved substantially less enthusiastic about jury trials in civil cases than have the federal courts. As examples of cases in which state courts rejected claims of entitlement to a jury, consider C&amp;K Engineering Contractors v. Amber Steel Co., 23 Cal. 3d 1 (1978) (contract actions based on promissory estoppel); Strauss v. Summerhays, 157 Cal. App. 3d 806 (1984) (quiet-title actions); Robair v. Dahl, 80 Mich. App. 458 (1978) (constructive trusts); State ex rel. Willman v. Sloan, 574 S.W.2d 421 (Mo. 1978) (calculation of damages after breach of a contractual covenant not to compete); Pelfrey v.

<li class=""><p id="c0e05dc7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why have state courts embraced the civil jury less warmly than the federal courts have? Two possibilities—one political, one practical—come to mind. First, the history of the Seventh Amendment, whose absence was thought by some to be so important as nearly to scuttle the ratification of the federal Constitution, might cause the federal courts to err on the side of the jury when in doubt. There was no equivalent controversy in most state constitutional debates: Civil juries were taken to be a matter of course. Second, federal courts can more easily absorb the costs of additional jury trials; federal courts are generally better financed than their state counterparts. Every time a state court creates a new right to civil jury trial, it is adding a strain on court budgets.</p></li>

</ol>
<p id="c0e084d8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">New claims create one set of jury trial problems for litigants and courts. Changing procedures creates another. At the time of the Seventh Amendment there were separate courts of law and equity. If a litigant needed relief from both (for example, first the reformation of a contract, then suit for damages on the reformed agreement), he would have to file two suits. Moreover, a good deal of adversarial jockeying could arise, with one party seeking remedies at law while the other sought equitable relief. In such cases, which court took precedence?</p>
<p id="c0e084d9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Federal Rules merged law and equity. Rules 1 and 2. Claims that were formerly legal or equitable could now be pleaded in the same suit, and the courts were given little guidance as to when a jury trial was required in a merged procedure. The constitutional right to jury trial still applied. The trouble was that the right that was “preserved” came from a system that no longer existed—that is, the right was preserved but the underlying procedural system was not. There was no particular difficulty in applying the historical approach to actions that could be denominated as clearly legal or equitable. For example, the typical personal injury suit was cognizable at law, and a suit seeking only injunctive relief was cognizable in equity. In such cases, a jury trial was granted or denied in accordance with the pre-merger practice.</p>

When a case blends equitable and legal claims—<i>and</i> there are overlapping factual issues—the judge should defer to the jury. He can do so by holding the equitable claims in abeyance until the jury renders its verdict. (If the equitable claims are pressing, the judge can grant a preliminary injunction, revisiting the matter in the light of the jury’s verdict.) Beacon Theatres, Inc. v.

<p id="c0e084e7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have looked at how judges are selected and challenged; we now turn to jurors. The battle over whether there will be a jury assumes that the jury—as an <span title="613" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-613">p. 613</span>institution—matters. In part that is true because jurors typically won’t look or think like judges. Part of the reason lies in the number of jurors: Groups make decisions differently than individuals do. And laypeople, drafted for temporary service, will see things differently than professionals for whom this is “another malpractice case” rather than a rare exposure to litigation. One sees these assumptions at work in the processes by which jurors are selected.</p>
<p id="c0e084e8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jurors are selected in ways that contrast sharply with the selection of judges. At common law, the sheriff was given very wide discretion in summoning jurors, and it was understood that he would summon people with both feet firmly planted in the established order. A medieval sheriff would have greeted the idea of a jury reflecting a demographic cross section first with incomprehension, then with horror. That outlook long prevailed. Not long ago, racial minorities, women, and members of the working class were often omitted from juries. The past 50 years have seen vast changes in these practices, both in the states and in the federal system. It is unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of race or gender in compiling the list from which jurors are summoned. Most jurisdictions go further by statutorily requiring jury selection pools that represent broad cross sections of the community. The federal courts’ policy about jury pools appears at 28 U.S.C. §1861: “[L]itigants. . . . entitled to trial by jury shall have the right to. . . . juries selected at random from a fair cross section of the community.  . . . ”</p>
<p id="c0e0abf9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A persistent piece of lawyers’ lore—a view sometimes expressed in press accounts of juries—is that juries, unlike judges, are more easily fooled, swayed by emotion, or otherwise likely to decide a case on the basis of something other than the evidence. Empirical studies cast doubt on this perception. One careful study concluded:</p>

<p id="c0e0abfa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, one of the more remarkable lessons that empirical study has to offer the law is that virtually no evidence exists to support the prevailing ingrained intuitions about juries.

<p id="c0e0abfe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To assemble a pool of prospective jurors, one has to decide whom to call to the courthouse.

For example, summoning jurors exclusively from voters’ rolls, lists of Social Security recipients, auto registrations, welfare lists, or college registration rolls would yield juries with substantially different characteristics. The manner in which the federal courts create cross-sectional summonses appear at 28 U.S.C. §§1863-1864 and §1866. The method for challenging a jury pool appears at 28 U.S.C. §1867(c). Notice that the federal statute, and most state analogues, do not entitle litigants to an actual jury representing a demographic cross section; instead they require that the entire list of potential jurors—consisting of thousands or tens of thousands of names (depending on the size of the district from which they are drawn) have those cross-sectional characteristics. Moreover, challenges to the pool as a whole must be made long before the actual jury is selected.</p>
<p id="c0e0ac00-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At one time many jury service statutes categorically exempted large groups of people, ranging from police officers to mothers to physicians. In recent decades state and federal statutes have dramatically reduced these occupational exemptions. The current federal list exempts only active members of the armed services, public safety officers, and some public officials, including judges. Some state statutes exclude even fewer categories (including, for example, judges as potential jurors), though all statutes allow jurors to be excused for individual hardship. The result is that contemporary jury pools reflect a broad array of age, occupation, education, and wealth. As a consequence, challenges to jury pools—more common at times when many persons were categorically excluded from jury service—are now rare.</p>

<p id="c0e0ac03-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the pool of all prospective jurors the clerk of the court or jury commissioner will send summonses to a number of jurors asking them to report for duty on a particular day. From among these prospective jurors a certain number—perhaps 30 or 40 for a 12-person jury (fewer for a 6-person jury)—are randomly selected and sent to a particular courtroom. From those in the courtroom 6 or 12 are selected to sit in the jury box for initial questioning, a process called <i>voir dire</i>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10434_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10434_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">5</a></span> This stage provides the parties a basis for exercising challenges to individual jurors.</p>
<p id="c0e0ac05-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The goal of voir dire is to identify unbiased jurors who can fairly hear and decide the case. Both the lawyers and the judge participate in the screening process. Typically, the judge will tell the parties a little bit about the case, identifying the parties and counsel and asking whether anyone on the jury panel is personally acquainted with or related to parties or counsel; if so, those jurors are excused. <span title="615" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-615">p. 615</span>The judge then typically asks each member of the potential jury briefly to describe their area of residence, occupation, and that of their spouse or partner. This questioning lays the groundwork for additional questioning by the lawyers. Here practice varies widely: In most federal courts, the individual lawyers submit questions to the judge who screens them and asks those she thinks helpful. In some state courts, by contrast, the lawyers are given a free hand to engage in detailed questioning. No matter who asks these questions, the answers provide the lawyers with a basis for challenging jurors. For some challenges—those “for cause"—the lawyers explain their basis for thinking the juror unsuitable for this case. For other challenges—"peremptory” challenges—the lawyers need not supply a reason—though, as we shall see, in recent years the courts have developed rules designed to prevent peremptory challenges from being used in ways that discriminate on the basis of race or gender.</p>

<p id="c0e0ac08-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where lawyers are allowed to question prospective jurors directly in voir dire, they have two goals—one obvious, the other below the surface. The obvious one is to identify any bias against their client or her cause. The less obvious one is to begin to “educate” jurors about their client’s case—by asking questions that emphasize the points they will later make during the formal presentation of evidence. ("[Prospective juror] Jones, do you believe that when someone has been injured because of another’s negligence, she is entitled to full compensation for her injuries?"—from plaintiff’s lawyer. “Ms. Jones, do you believe that before someone is required to turn his hard-earned dollars over to another, that other should have to prove that her injuries were in fact caused by the defendant?"—from defendant’s counsel.) There are limits to lawyers’ ability to use voir dire in this way: The judge will step in if the efforts are blatant, but lawyers will often approach this line as closely as they can, figuring that the chance to make a good first impression during voir dire is too good to pass up.</p>
<p id="c0e0d319-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No statute defines the standards governing challenges for cause. A representative case describing the judicially developed principles stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0e0d31a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We review the district court’s refusal to strike a juror for cause for an abuse of discretion, keeping in mind that the district court is in the best position to observe the juror and to make a first-hand evaluation of his ability to be fair. The district court must grant a challenge for cause, however, if a prospective juror shows actual prejudice or bias. Actual bias can be shown either by the juror’s own admission of bias or “by proof of specific facts which show the juror has such a close connection to the facts at trial that bias is presumed.”</p>
<p id="c0e0d31b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our recent <i>Vasey</i> decision, we noted that “courts have presumed bias in extraordinary situations where a prospective juror has had a <i>direct</i> financial interest in the trial’s outcome.” As examples of such extraordinary situations, we cited a case in which a prospective juror was a stockholder in or an employee of a corporation that was a <span title="616" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-616">p. 616</span>party to the suit. “In these situations, the relationship between the prospective juror and a party to the lawsuit ’point[s] so sharply to bias in [the] particular juror’ that even the juror’s own assertions of impartiality must be discounted in ruling on a challenge for cause.”</p>

<p id="c0e0d31d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the cited case, the prospective juror owned stock in defendant Wal-Mart, which also employed his wife; the court held that in spite of the prospective juror’s statement that he would base his decision on the law and the facts, it was an abuse of discretion to refuse to dismiss him for cause. Some other clear-cut examples of justified challenges for cause might be instances where a juror was related to a party (or its lawyer) or where the juror was currently involved in similar litigation.</p>
<p id="c0e0d31e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What if jurors conceal or lie on voir dire? The first question is how a lawyer would find out. Jurors answer the voir dire questions under oath, but there is no official investigation of their accuracy. Consequently, lawyers find out about anomalies mostly by chance. Once a lawyer determines that a juror was not candid during voir dire, what recourse does she have? Procedurally, the route is to move for a new trial; but when will one be granted? The leading case on that question, McDonough Power Equipment v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548 (1984), established the standard for challenging a verdict on the basis of inaccurate answers on voir dire:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0e0d31f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that to obtain a new trial in such a situation, a party must first demonstrate that a juror <i>failed to answer honestly a material question</i> on voir dire, and then further show that <i>a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.</i></p>

<p id="c0e0d321-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to an unlimited number of challenges for cause, parties are also permitted a limited number of peremptory challenges—challenges the party need not justify in any way. In civil cases in federal court (where the Rules provide that juries consist of 6 to 12 people), parties are entitled to three peremptory challenges. 28 U.S.C. §1870. States establish various numbers of peremptory challenges. What justifies peremptory challenges? One view is that peremptories in effect allow the parties to choose their juries, thus giving any ensuing verdict greater legitimacy in their eyes. A softer justification is that peremptories allow parties to excuse a juror about whom they have a hunch that does not rise to the level of a challenge for cause, or whom they may have offended through vigorous (but unsuccessful) voir dire questioning. Still a third justification, if it is that, holds that peremptories allow lawyers to exercise various hunches about the characteristics of social groups: Are blue-collar, rural whites of northern European descent likely to be more defense-oriented than African-American Catholics? Are elderly accountants less generous than young race car drivers? And so on.</p>
<p id="c0e0d322-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Taken to the extreme, however, peremptories conflict with the ideas of the cross-sectional jury embodied in statutes like 28 U.S.C. §1861. If society believes that juries composed of many different viewpoints are desirable, does it make sense to allow parties to negate that goal through the use of peremptories? In recent decades the Supreme Court (as well as statutes and common law decisions in <span title="617" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-617">p. 617</span>many states) has changed the law and the landscape regarding peremptory challenges. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that unaccountability in peremptories stops when race and gender enter the picture. In Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), the Court in a criminal case held that the prosecution’s systematic striking of Black jurors without a justification based on nonracial factors violated the defendant’s and jurors’ rights to equal protection, and harmed the community at large. Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614 (1991), extended <i>Batson</i> to civil cases, and subsequent cases have expanded the impermissible categories to include gender. J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127 (1994).</p>

How do such objections to challenges work?

But he failed to do that. The venire contained 20 prospective jurors, and more than enough were left to make up a full jury of 8 when he refused to excuse her. A candid and thoughtful person, if one may judge from the transcript, Leiter would probably have made an excellent juror—in another case.  . . . ”</p></li>

THE FINAL PRETRIAL CONFERENCE AND ORDER</p></h2></div>


<p id="c0e12054-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At this point our examination of trial pivots from “Who?” to “How?” Up to now, the chapter has examined the law surrounding the people who will hear and decide a case if it goes to trial. We now turn to the rules that structure the trial, beginning with a process that one can with equal accuracy describe as the end of pleading or the start of trial—the final pretrial conference.</p>
<p id="c0e12055-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One would expect that the question posed by this section’s heading would long since have been answered. Isn’t that what pleadings are for? And, if some of the allegations in those pleadings lacked factual or legal support, would they not have disappeared in motions on the pleadings and summary judgment?</p>
<p id="c0e12056-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps. But because discovery will not resolve all factual questions, and because counsel may wish to leave open as late as possible alternative legal theories of their claims and defenses, there may still be some question about what issues trial will address. Modern civil litigation does not leave these questions open until the trial itself. One way in which the Federal Rules force answers to these ques­tions is by requiring, through Rule 16(e), a “final pretrial conference and order.”</p>
<p id="c0e12057-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other conferences with the court, including the scheduling conference mandated by Rule 16(b) and optional pretrial conferences the judge may hold to discuss various matters, focus primarily on the pretrial stage of the case and, perhaps, efforts to settle or dismiss before trial. The final pretrial conference, in contrast, assumes a trial will occur—and soon. The final pretrial conference aims solely at clarifying the issues that trial will be about—"to formulate a trial plan,” as the Rule puts it. As Rule 16(e) states, the “conference must be held as close to the start of the trial as is reasonable,” and goes on to state that “[t]he court may modify the order issued after a final pretrial conference only to prevent manifest injustice.” Contrast that rather stern statement with the permissive standard for amending pleadings ("The court should freely give leave [to amend a pleading] when justice so requires.” Rule 15(a)). A final pretrial order—and an unsuccessful effort to convince the court to allow an amendment—is at stake in the next case.</p>

<p id="c0e1205d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sherman Shatwell went to the hospital complaining of neck pain. Tests showed he probably had throat cancer. It was treatable but required immediate attention. Thanks to a variety of bureaucratic blunders the news never made it to him. Instead, Mr. Shatwell was sent home with a prescription for antibiotics. By the time he learned the truth a year later, it was too late.</p>
<p id="c0e1205e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Eventually, his widowed wife pursued negligence claims against the doctors and hospital. Through twenty months of motions practice and discovery and all the way <span title="620" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-620">p. 620</span>through their submissions for the final pretrial order the defendants maintained a unified front, denying any negligence by anyone. Then, two weeks before trial, some of the defendants settled. Dr. Kenneth Phillips wasn’t one of those. Left to stand trial and with just days before jury selection, he sought permission to amend the pretrial order so he could revamp his trial strategy. Now he wanted to pursue a defense pinning the blame on the absent settling defendants, arguing that they were indeed negligent and that they—not he—should be held responsible for any damages. Dr. Phillips’s motion to amend the final pretrial order sought permission to introduce new jury instructions, exhibits, and witnesses aimed at advancing this new defense. But the district court denied the motion and at the trial’s end the jury found him liable for damages of a little over $1 million. Dr. Phillips now asks us to overturn the judgment, contending that the district court’s refusal to amend the final pretrial order and allow his new defense amounts to reversible error.</p>
<p id="c0e1205f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Final pretrial orders seek to “formulate a trial plan.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(e). In their complaints and answers lawyers and parties today often list every alternative and contradictory claim or defense known to the law; during discovery they sometimes depose every potential witness still breathing and collect every bit and byte of evidence technology, time, and money will allow. Final pretrial orders seek to tame such exuberant modern pretrial practices and focus the mind on the impending reality of trial. “The casual pleading [and discovery] indulged by the courts under the Federal Rules. . . . has quite naturally led to"—some might say required—"more and more emphasis on pre-trial hearings and statements to define the issues” for trial. Meadow Gold Prods. Co. v. Wright, 278 F.2d 867, 868-69 (D.C. Cir. 1960). Leaving the reins so loose at the front end of the case requires some method of gathering them up as the end approaches. At trial you just can’t argue every contradictory and mutually exclusive claim or defense you were able to conjure in your pleadings: juries would lose faith in your credibility. Neither can you present the millions of documents and the scores of witnesses you were able to dig up in discovery: no sensible judge would tolerate it. Final pretrial orders encourage both sides to edit their scripts, peel away any pleading and discovery bluster, and disclose something approximating their real trial intentions to opposing counsel and the court. Toward those ends, the parties are often asked—as they were in this case—to specify the witnesses and exhibits, supply the proposed jury instructions, and identify the claims and defenses they actually intend to introduce at trial.</p>
<p id="c0e14770-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While pretrial orders entered earlier in the life of a case often deal with interstitial questions like discovery staging and motions practice and are relatively easy to amend as a result, a final pretrial order focused on formulating a plan for an impending trial may be amended “only to prevent manifest injustice.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(e). Even that standard isn’t meant to preclude any flexibility—trials are high human dramas; surprises always emerge; and no judge worth his salt can forget or fail to sympathize with the challenges the trial lawyer confronts. For all our extensive pretrial procedures, even the most meticulous trial plan today probably remains no more reliable a guide than the script in a high school play—provisional at best and with surprising deviations guaranteed. At the same time, the standard for modifying a final pretrial order is as high as it is to ensure everyone involved has sufficient incentive to fulfill the order’s dual purposes of encouraging self-editing and <span title="621" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-621">p. 621</span>providing reasonably fair disclosure to the court and opposing parties alike of their real trial intentions. This court will review a district court’s decision to amend or not to amend a pretrial order only for abuse of discretion.</p>
<p id="c0e14771-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We see nothing like that here. Dr. Phillips says that he was surprised when his co-defendants left him to stand trial and that the court was insufficiently sympathetic to his desire to revamp his trial strategy in light of the last-minute settlement. But can a partial settlement really come as a surprise in an age when virtually all cases settle in part or in whole, many on the eve of trial? Especially in multiparty litigation, where an incentive exists to break ranks, settle relatively cheaply, and leave others on the hook before the jury? The truth is, what happened in this case was hardly unforeseeable. Like many before him in multi-defendant cases, Dr. Phillips initially saw profit in presenting a united front with his co-defendants only to regret the decision later. United front defenses often present a tempting choice at the outset of multiparty cases and through discovery. Parties can pool their resources and efforts in joint defense arrangements. Besides, no one likes to throw overboard someone else in the same boat. But the complications associated with this strategic choice often come home to roost as trial nears. An attractive partial settlement may be dangled before one defendant and not others. The settling defendant may get a good deal, replenish an opponent’s litigation coffers depleted through exhausting pretrial litigation, and leave others exposed at trial for the bulk of the plaintiff’s damages. Remaining defendants can be left wishing for a defense or evidence or witnesses forgone. If a remaining defendant’s attorney counted on a colleague working for a settling party to do the heavy lifting at trial he may feel flat-footed when it comes to examining witnesses and arguing motions. Even if all the defendants do go to trial, failing to obtain experts and gather evidence to show contributory negligence by co-defendants can exact its toll and lead to regret. Multiparty litigation presents a variety of collective action problems and other strategic pitfalls and those Dr. Phillips encountered here are well known, not the stuff of surprise.</p>
<p id="c0e14772-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It’s hard, as well, to ignore the prejudice the other side can experience in these circumstances. Dr. Phillips effectively sought to force the plaintiff to prepare for an entirely different trial on a few days’ notice. For the better part of two years the defendants presented a united front. Even in their final pretrial order submissions they didn’t designate experts to suggest one or another of the codefendants acted unprofessionally. They didn’t submit documents to prove such a claim. They didn’t propose jury instructions asking that someone else be held accountable. The closest they came to suggesting contributory negligence was to prepare boilerplate blaming unspecified others for Mr. Shatwell’s injuries. Beyond that, through the long months of discovery and into their final Rule 16(e) submissions, nothing. In these circumstances, the plaintiff and her lawyers had some reasonable expectations about what trial would look like and the sort of evidence they would—and would not—need. They knew they’d need to prove negligence by the defendants who chose to go to trial but they wouldn’t have to worry about finger pointing between defendants; trial would present one set of challenges but not another.</p>
<p id="c0e14773-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may be that the district court could have allowed Dr. Phillips to rejigger his defense at the last minute and afforded the plaintiff more time to prepare for it. But we do not see why that outcome was mandatory. A district court does not abuse its <span title="622" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-622">p. 622</span>discretion in holding a party to a long-scheduled trial and to the strategy he articulated though pleading and discovery and in the face of such obvious risks, especially when indulging an eleventh-hour strategic shift would mean either imposing prejudice on the other side or inviting more delay. So beware: when a fellow litigant settles on the eve of trial you can’t bank on the right to claim surprise and rewrite your case from top to bottom.</p>
<p id="c0e14774-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many of Dr. Phillips’s remaining arguments echo his Rule 16 complaint and fail with it. . . . </p>

<p id="c0e16e93-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Phillips ended up losing big in this case.

From another point of view—the one adopted by the court—Phillips’s lawyer wasn’t looking far enough ahead, thinking about the possibility that the some or all of the codefendants would settle.</p>
<p id="c0e16e94-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose Phillips’s lawyer had contemplated this possibility. (Phillips’s lawyer may well have been hired by a liability insurer and, if so, was likely to be familiar with such multi-defendant cases.) What could she have done? If you look back to Chapter 8, two possibilities present themselves. One is an agreement among defendants about how, if they are held liable, they will apportion the costs among themselves. Another is a sliding scale agreement with the plaintiff, spelling out how liability will be apportioned given various settlements and adjudicated outcomes.</p>

<p id="c0e16e97-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once a jury—a second potential decision maker—enters the picture, one needs principles defining judges’ and juries’ respective spheres of competence and power. At trial, lawyers will present witnesses and evidence and offer their most compelling description of their clients’ claims and defenses to the jurors deciding the case. Yet jurors are, by definition, laypeople who may have little clue about the law underlying the stories they will hear from the parties, how to weigh the information at their disposal, or how many of them must agree to render a verdict. Accordingly, judges must instruct and guide juries at several points before and during their deliberations.</p>
<div id="c0e16e98-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0e195a9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">1.&nbsp;Instruction and Comment</p></h3></div>

<p id="c0e195aa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jurors will often not know the substantive law, so the judge teaches that law through jury instructions. See Rule 51. Notice that like so much else in U.S. procedure, this too depends on the parties, who must request instructions, and, in the absence of an objection, may not complain that the judge has wrongly instructed the jury. As you approach your first trial, work out proposed jury instructions way in advance of anything else—otherwise they will sneak up and bite you from behind.</p>
<p id="c0e195ab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Instructions explain the substantive law that applies to the case, and the judge explains in a sequential way the decisions the jury must reach in a given case. For example, if the jury determines that the defendant was negligent, it must then decide whether the defendant’s negligence caused the injury of which the plaintiff is complaining.</p>
<p id="c0e195ac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="624" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-624">p. 624</span>Jury instructions have two audiences. Their first audience is the jury itself, who may have an intuitive understanding of the law (quite likely in a negligence case) or none at all (as, for example, in antitrust). The second audience for jury instructions is the appellate court, which will reverse a case if an instruction misstates the law in a material way. These audiences have essentially incompatible requirements. The jury wants a simplified, easy-to-follow path through the wilderness of evidence to help it distinguish the central from the peripheral and to explain what factors should go into its decision on each question. The appellate court wants a nuanced, perfectly balanced, all-inclusive statement of the law. The clash between these contradictory requirements means that most instructions are compromises. Traditionally, juries received no instructions until the case was finished, at which point jurors sometimes learned they had been paying attention to the wrong things. Today some courts are experimenting with staged instructions, instructing juries on aspects of the law pertinent to particular parts of evidence as it comes in; preliminary information suggests the staged instructions are helpful.</p>
<p id="c0e195ad-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Besides telling the jury what the law is, the judge may tell the jury what she thinks of the evidence. Here the law speaks to the judge with a mixed voice. In federal courts at least, the judge has the theoretical power to comment on the evidence. That power is hedged, however, with many qualifications and with exhortations that the judge not trespass onto the jury’s autonomous decision-making space. Judges who do so egregiously—like the judge who solemnly informed a jury that in his experience witnesses who wiped their hands while testifying were liars, Quercia v. United States, 289 U.S. 466, 468 (1933)—are reversed.</p>

<p id="c0e195b0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Early medieval juries were supposed already to know the relevant facts (Was John seised of Blackacre on the day the Old King died?). Modern juries are supposed to know nothing about the case except what they learn at trial; a juror who said he’d been at the intersection at the time of the accident and was familiar with both parties’ driving records—making him an ideal medieval juror—would immediately be excused for cause.</p>
<p id="c0e195b1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Besides proper instructions about the law, juries need insulation from improper influences. The process starts well before trial gets under way. Screening the jury through voir dire (see supra page 614) seeks to eliminate jurors whose sympathies or inability to understand the evidence might cause them to reach irrational verdicts. During the trial, judges try to ensure that jurors will consider only information screened through the law of evidence (many of whose parts can be explained as efforts to insulate jurors from information that might be misleading).</p>
<p id="c0e195b2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even good-faith efforts by jurors to bring their fellow jurors information not filtered through the evidentiary and adversarial screens may result in reversal. For example, in a case that turned on whether aluminum electrical wiring was dangerous, one juror, after hearing testimony to that effect, went home, examined the wiring in his own home, and reported his findings to his fellow jurors the next day. The appellate court ordered a new trial. In re Beverly Hills Fire Litigation, 695 F.2d 207 (6th Cir. 1982).</p>

In extreme instances, where the case is the subject of much public discussion, the judge can sequester the jury. In recent years the wide availability of web-based information has posed another problem. Lawyers and judges report juries “contaminated” by jurors who research matters at issue in the trial (What does the intersection look like? Have others reported injuries from this product? Has defendant been sued by others?), and judges will often instruct jurors not to use such tools.</p>

At early common law a jury consisted of 12 persons; the verdict was required to be unanimous; and the verdict could be attacked only by “attaint,” a process in which a second jury, twice as large, considered charges that the first jury had been deliberately untruthful in its verdict. Those rules have changed—in the federal courts—in recent decades.</p>
<p id="c0e1bcc7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the widely criticized decision of Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U.S. 149 (1973), the Supreme Court constitutionalized six-person civil juries, which are now in widespread use in federal courts and in some states. What difference does it make? Fundamentally, a smaller jury is less “average,” less representative. Smaller juries are less likely to include any given point of view or social characteristic—race, political views, economic status, and so on. Just as a single individual is more likely to be eccentric than a large group, so smaller juries are more likely to render aberrant verdicts than are larger juries.</p>
<p id="c0e1bcc8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the federal system, unanimous verdicts in civil cases are still required unless the parties agree to accept a nonunanimous verdict. See Rule 48. Some states permit nonunanimous verdicts, usually allowing two or three opposing votes on a 12-person jury. Again one can ask what difference it makes. Rules of unanimity will result in more hung juries (a single holdout can block a verdict), requiring a retrial. Balanced against this loss of efficiency are some studies suggesting that groups where unanimity is required discuss the evidence with more intensity and in more detail than do groups where unanimity is not required.</p>
<p id="c0e1bcc9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice that, combined, these changes in size and decision rules can magnify each other. Decreasing the size of the jury reduces the likelihood that any given social characteristic will be reflected in the jury’s membership. Moreover, abolishing the unanimity requirement lessens the effect that social diversity will have on the jury’s verdict: If jurors do not have to render a unanimous verdict, the majority can simply ignore the point of view of one or two individuals.</p>

<p id="c0e1bccb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the procedures described in the preceding sections work as planned, the litigants will face a judge and a jury who can approach the case without bias. But even an unbiased fact-finder can go wrong. The system therefore worries about two problems: juries reaching verdicts unsustainable in logic; and, conversely, judges <span title="626" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-626">p. 626</span>improperly seizing control of litigation from juries. The next two sections examine the procedures and doctrines designed to prevent either of these from happening. At the outset, it’s worth noting that judges and juries appear to agree with each other in the very great majority of cases.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10637_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10637_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">6</a></span> So the cases and principles examined here apply in the cases where judge and jury disagree. Who then prevails—and how?</p>
<p id="c0e1bccd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several circumstances make it difficult to police the boundary between these shared responsibilities. First, in modern civil procedure only closely balanced cases will come to trial. Summary judgment will have weeded out most of the rest. Accordingly, every case should be a close one. Second, we have aspirations for the jury beyond simple fact-finding, although finding facts in the midst of conflict and perjury is hardly simple. The jury also serves as the voice of the community, tempering and making acceptable applications of law that might otherwise be resented or resisted. Finally, it is a temporary, lay, and democratic institution that stands at the core of a permanent, professional, and elite institution—the judiciary. The two latter roles conflict at times with fact-finding, at least if that task is understood in a limited way. To ask juries to decide cases, then, is to permit them—or even to require them—to do something more than find facts. If one accepts these propositions, the task of procedure becomes more difficult. The litigation system is dedicated to rationality. It is also, however, committed to a model of fact-finding that blends rationality with other goals. How does one frame procedural rules that give juries sufficient leeway to perform the tasks we have set for them without irreparably compromising the rationality of verdicts?</p>

In a negligence case, the plaintiff presents no evidence that the defendant’s negligence caused the accident. Or in a case where the defense rests solely on the statute of limitations, the only evidence points to the critical events having occurred within the statute. In such cases the opposing party can ask the judge to grant “judgment as a matter of law.” Read Rule 50(a). If the court grants such a motion, the jury will not receive the case (or that part of it as to which the motion is granted). Historically, the grant of such a motion was called a “directed verdict,”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10655_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10655_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">7</a></span> a term that many state courts and lawyers continue to use.</p>

Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133 (2000). At both summary judgment and directed verdict, the question is whether—drawing all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party and avoiding credibility determinations or weighing of the evidence—the party with the burden of production has put forth sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.</p>

This phrase captures an essential implication of party responsibility for proof. The system assigns to the parties—more precisely to one of the parties—the responsibility for investigating, discovering, marshaling evidence, and presenting that evidence to the trier of fact. If that party fails to carry the burden assigned, she loses the case. You have already seen the burden of production operating in summary judgment. At the heart of <i>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett</i>, supra page 573, lies a hard truth: A party with the burden of production can lose even before trial if she fails to demonstrate, among the facts uncovered by investigation and discovery, sufficient evidence to allow a rational trier of fact to find in her favor.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0e1e3e6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To understand why lawyers care about burdens of production, take an example from a simple auto accident case. Plaintiff has the burden of production on negligence. What does that mean in practice? First, the plaintiff has to decide how she is going to show defendant’s negligence: Will she base it on faulty maintenance, speeding, inebriation, failure to watch opposing traffic, driving in spite of a disabling medical condition, or some other breach of care? This initial decision will flow in large measure from plaintiff’s sense of the facts: One would risk sanctions as well as failure on the merits if one based one’s case on defendant’s inebriation without having any factual foundation.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0e1e3e7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Let’s assume that plaintiff reports that defendant ran the red light. That would provide an adequate basis for pleading negligence while meeting the factual foundation requirements of Rule 11. Discovery might, of course, turn up other information—faulty maintenance of defendant’s brakes, say—and it might cast doubt on the original theory: Plaintiff thinks she saw defendant run the light, but other, disinterested witnesses deny it. Whatever plaintiff’s theory of negligence, she has the responsibility for gathering and presenting evidence on that theory. Let’s assume that plaintiff thinks her strongest case is the “defendant ran the light” story. To carry her burden of production on the question of whether the defendant ran the red light, it is up to plaintiff <span title="628" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-628">p. 628</span>to find the witnesses, interview or depose them, get their affidavits (to avoid summary judgment), make sure they come to court on the day of trial, and conduct the direct examination in a way that makes their statements admissible. If the plaintiff fails in any of these steps, she loses—even though, as a matter of historical fact, the defendant did run the red light. The plaintiff loses because she has failed to satisfy the burden of production—of coming forward with evidence from which a rational trier of fact could conclude some proposition of material fact.</p></li>

For example, in a negligence case, the plaintiff will have the burden of production on the defendant’s negligence. By contrast, if the defendant pleads the statute of limitations as a defense, the defendant will have the burden of producing facts to support that defense. Suppose that the plaintiff was exposed to some allegedly toxic chemicals, perhaps as a result of the defendant’s negligence. The statute of limitations is one year, and under state law the statute runs from the time the plaintiff should reasonably have realized that she was injured. Plaintiff filed suit more than a year after exposure alleging injuries from the exposure.</p>

<p id="c0e20b09-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With these foundational matters to one side, the great and difficult question in directing verdicts lies before us: When may a court interfere with the jury’s fact-finding and law-applying role? We have already explored these questions as they relate to summary judgment. In <i>Houchens</i> (supra page 38), we saw a situation in which the court granted summary judgment because there was no evidence from which a rational fact-finder could have found for Mrs. Houchens. But what if there’s <i>some</i> evidence? Can a judge decide whom to believe? The well-established law in this area says that a judge may never make a credibility determination in granting judgment as a matter of law—credibility is a matter for the jury. Nor may a judge “weigh” the evidence, as opposed to finding whether there <i>is</i> any evidence from which the jury could find for the party against whom the motion is directed. When you read <i>Tolan</i> and <i>Bias</i> (in Chapter 8), you considered whether the courts had followed these tenets in the summary judgment context. In the next case, an appeal of a directed verdict, decide whether the U.S. Supreme Court is adhering to these standards or fudging them.</p>

<p id="c0e20b0f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is an action brought by respondent against petitioner to recover for the death of a brakeman, alleged to have been caused by petitioner’s negligence. The complaint alleges that the deceased, at the time of the accident resulting in his death, <span title="630" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-630">p. 630</span>was assisting in the yard work of breaking up and making up trains and in the classifying and assorting of cars operating in interstate commerce; that in pursuance of such work, while riding a cut of cars, other cars ridden by fellow employees were negligently caused to be brought into violent contact with those upon which deceased was riding, with the result that he was thrown therefrom to the railroad track and run over by a car or cars, inflicting injuries from which he died.</p>
<p id="c0e23220-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court directed the jury to find a verdict in favor of petitioner. Judgment upon a verdict so found was reversed by the court of appeals, Judge Swan dissenting.</p>
<p id="c0e23221-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That part of the yard in which the accident occurred contained a lead track and a large number of switching tracks branching therefrom. The lead track crossed a “hump,” and the work of car distribution consisted of pushing a train of cars by means of a locomotive to the top of the “hump,” and then allowing the cars, in separate strings, to descend by gravity, under the control of hand brakes, to their respective destinations in the various branch tracks. Deceased had charge of a string of two gondola cars, which he was piloting to track 14. Immediately ahead of him was a string of seven cars, and behind him a string of nine cars, both also destined for track 14. Soon after the cars ridden by deceased had passed to track 14, his body was found on that track some distance beyond the switch. He had evidently fallen onto the track and been run over by a car or cars.</p>
<p id="c0e23222-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case for respondent rests wholly upon the claim that the fall of deceased was caused by a violent collision of the string of nine cars with the string ridden by deceased. Three employees, riding the nine-car string, testified positively that no such collision occurred. They were corroborated by every other employee in a position to see, all testifying that there was no contact between the nine-car string and that of the deceased. The testimony of these witnesses, if believed, establishes beyond doubt that there was no collision between these two strings of cars, and that the nine-car string contributed in no way to the accident. The only witness who testified for the respondent was one Bainbridge; and it is upon his testimony alone that respondent’s right to recover is sought to be upheld. His testimony is concisely stated, in its most favorable light for respondent, in the prevailing opinion below by Judge Learned Hand, as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0e23223-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff’s only witness to the event, one Bainbridge, then employed by the road, stood close to the yardmaster’s office, near the “hump.” He professed to have paid little attention to what went on, but he did see the deceased riding at the rear of his cars, whose speed when they passed him he took to be about eight or ten miles. Shortly thereafter a second string passed which was shunted into another track and this was followed by the nine, which, according to the plaintiff’s theory, collided with the deceased’s. After the nine cars had passed at a somewhat greater speed than the deceased’s, Bainbridge paid no more attention to either string for a while, but looked again when the deceased, who was still standing in his place, had passed the switch and onto the assorting track where he was bound. At that time his speed had been checked to about three miles, but the speed of the following nine cars had increased. They were just passing the switch, about four or five cars behind the deceased. Bainbridge looked away again and soon heard what he described as a “loud crash,” not however an unusual event in a switching yard. Apparently this did not cause him at once to turn, but he did so shortly thereafter, <span title="631" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-631">p. 631</span>and saw the two strings together still moving, and the deceased no longer in sight. Later still his attention was attracted by shouts and he went to the spot and saw the deceased between the rails. Until he left to go to the accident, he had stood fifty feet to the north of the track where the accident happened, and about nine hundred feet from where the body was found.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0e23224-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court, although regarding Bainbridge’s testimony as not only “somewhat suspicious in itself, but its contradiction. . . . so manifold as to leave little doubt,” held, nevertheless, that the question was one of fact depending upon the credibility of the witnesses, and that it was for the jury to determine, as between the one witness and the many, where the truth lay. The dissenting opinion of Judge Swan proceeds upon the theory that Bainbridge did not testify that in fact a collision had taken place, but inferred it because he heard a crash, and because thereafter the two strings of cars appeared to him to be moving together. It is correctly pointed out in that opinion, however, that the crash might have come from elsewhere in the busy yard and that Bainbridge was in no position to see whether the two strings of cars were actually together; that Bainbridge repeatedly said he was paying no particular attention; and that his position was such, being 900 feet from the place where the body was found and less than 50 feet from the side of the track in question, that he necessarily saw the strings of cars at such an acute angle that it would be physically impossible even for an attentive observer to tell whether the forward end of the nine-car cut was actually in contact with the rear end of the two-car cut. The dissenting opinion further points out that all the witnesses who were in a position to see testified that there was no collision; that respondent’s evidence was wholly circumstantial, and the inferences which might otherwise be drawn from it were shown to be utterly erroneous unless all of petitioner’s witnesses were willful perjurers. “This is not a case,” the opinion proceeds, “where direct testimony to an essential fact is contradicted by direct testimony of other witnesses, though even there it is conceded a directed verdict might be proper in some circumstances. Here, when all the testimony was in, the circumstantial evidence in support of negligence was thought by the trial judge to be so insubstantial and insufficient that it did not justify submission to the jury.” We thus summarize and quote from the prevailing and dissenting opinions, because they present the divergent views to be considered in reaching a correct determination of the question involved. It, of course, is true, generally, that where there is a direct conflict of testimony upon a matter of fact, the question must be left to the jury to determine, without regard to the number of witnesses upon either side. But here there really is no conflict in the testimony as to the <i>facts</i>. The witnesses for petitioner flatly testified that there was no collision between the nine-car and the two-car strings. Bainbridge did not say there was such a collision. What he said was that he heard a “loud crash,” which did not cause him at once to turn, but that shortly thereafter he did turn and saw the two strings of cars moving together with the deceased no longer in sight; that there was nothing unusual about the crash of cars—it happened every day; that there was nothing about this crash to attract his attention except that it was extra loud; that he paid no attention to it; that it was not sufficient to attract his attention. The record shows that there was a continuous movement of cars over and down the “hump,” which were distributed among a large number of branch tracks within the yard, and that any two strings of these cars moving upon the same track might <span title="632" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-632">p. 632</span>have come together and caused the crash which Bainbridge heard. There is no direct evidence that <i>in fact</i> the crash was occasioned by a collision of the two strings in question; and it is perfectly clear that no such fact was brought to Bainbridge’s attention as a perception of the physical sense of sight or of hearing. At most there was an inference to that effect drawn from observed facts which gave equal support to the opposite inference that the crash was occasioned by the coming together of other strings of cars entirely away from the scene of the accident, or of the two-car string ridden by deceased and the seven-car string immediately ahead of it.</p>

There is strictly no evidence to warrant a jury in finding that the loss was occasioned by negligence and not by theft. When the evidence tends equally to sustain either of two inconsistent propositions, neither of them can be said to have been established by legitimate proof. A verdict in favor of the party bound to maintain one of those propositions against the other is necessarily wrong.</p>

<p id="c0e23228-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That Bainbridge concluded from what he himself observed that the crash was due to a collision between the two strings of cars in question is sufficiently indicated by his statements. But this, of course, proves nothing, since it is not allowable for a witness to resolve the doubt as to which of two equally justifiable inferences shall be adopted by drawing a conclusion, which, if accepted, will result in a purely gratuitous award in favor of the party who has failed to sustain the burden of proof cast upon him by the law.</p>
<p id="c0e23229-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And the desired inference is precluded for the further reason that respondent’s right of recovery depends upon the existence of a particular fact which must be inferred from proven facts, and this is not permissible in the face of the positive and otherwise uncontradicted testimony of unimpeached witnesses consistent with the facts actually proved, from which testimony it affirmatively appears that the fact sought to be inferred did not exist. . . . </p>
<p id="c0e2322a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not only is Bainbridge’s testimony considered as a whole suspicious, insubstantial and insufficient, but his statement that when he turned shortly after hearing the crash the two strings were moving together is simply incredible, if he meant thereby to be understood as saying that he saw the two in contact; and if he meant by the words “moving together” simply that they were moving at the same time in the same direction but not in contact, the statement becomes immaterial. As we have already seen he was paying slight and only occasional attention to what was going on. The cars were 800 or 900 feet from where he stood and moving almost directly away from him, his angle of vision being only 3°03 from a straight line. At that sharp angle <span title="633" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-633">p. 633</span>and from that distance, near dusk of a misty evening (as the proof shows), the practical impossibility of the witness being able to see whether the front of the nine-car string was in contact with the back of the two-car string is apparent. And, certainly, in the light of these conditions, no verdict based upon a statement so unbelievable reasonably could be sustained as against the positive testimony to the contrary of unimpeached witnesses, all in a position to see, as this witness was not, the precise relation of the cars to one another. The fact that these witnesses were employees of the petitioner, under the circumstances here disclosed, does not impair this conclusion. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. v.

<p id="c0e28057-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It does not appear to us impossible, or indeed improbable, that one in [Bainbridge’s] position could tell whether the two strings were together. The intervals between cars in a train are uniform; they may be detected by the straight sides. Certainly a gap of four or five car lengths, when the nine cars came to rest, would have been easily observable; and this was the story of the defendant. What Bainbridge saw, coupled with what he had heard, if uncontradicted, would be enough to support a finding that the nine cars had collided with the deceased’s and thrown him off. There is no inherent impossibility in the story.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0e2805a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cases such as <i>Chamberlain</i> have been thought to raise two related issues. The first is the precise standard for taking the case from the jury—more particularly, which evidence should be considered by the court when deciding whether to do so. There is general agreement that the court should consider all evidence favorable to the nonmoving party, all inferences from that evidence, and all undisputed evidence. But should the court also consider testimonial and disputed evidence in favor of the moving party? Closely related is the matter of evaluating the evidence. Many courts have stated that the basic test is whether reasonable persons could differ; if they could, the court should defer to the jury on the ground that its members are reasonable persons whose verdict represents one of several reasonable views. A leading case articulating the prevailing view is Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 411 F.2d 365, 374-75 (5th Cir. 1969):</p>

<p id="c0e2805b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On motions for directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict [both now called judgment as a matter of law] the Court should consider all of the evidence—not just that evidence which supports the non-mover’s case—but in the light and with all reasonable inferences most favorable to the party opposed to the motion. If the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the Court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict, granting of the motions is proper. On the other hand, if there is substantial evidence opposed to the motions, that is, evidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions, the motions should be denied, and the case submitted to the jury. A mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient to present <span title="635" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-635">p. 635</span>a question for the jury. The motions for [judgment as a matter of law] should not be decided by which side has the better of the case, nor should they be granted only when there is a complete absence of probative facts to support a jury verdict. There must be a conflict in substantial evidence to create a jury question. However, it is the function of the jury as the traditional finder of the facts, and not the Court, to weigh conflicting evidence and inferences, and determine the credibility of witnesses.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0e2805c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Chamberlain</i>, the Court has to avoid questions of credibility because the jury is the undoubted arbiter of credibility. But we ask jurors to do much more than to decide who is telling the truth. We also give to the jury many questions that require them to apply general, open-ended standards to specific facts of the case. Was it negligent under these circumstances to be driving five miles faster than the speed limit? Was the behavior of one of the contracting parties unreasonable? To arrive at answers to such questions, juries may have to decide questions of fact. But even after doing so they must then apply the open texture of law to those facts.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0e2805d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because of this role, courts often give to juries cases where the facts are undisputed. A classic example is Railroad Co. v. Stout, 84 U.S. 657 (1873). A child was injured while playing on a railroad turntable located at the edge of a sparsely populated rural settlement. The turntable was not locked or fenced. No one contested any of these facts; the case went to the jury, which found negligence. Rejecting the railroad’s contentions that the judge should have taken the case from the jury, the Supreme Court wrote:</p>

<p id="c0e2805e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon the facts proven in such cases, it is a matter of judgment and discretion, of sound inference, what is the deduction to be drawn from the undisputed facts. Certain facts we may suppose to be clearly established from which one sensible, impartial man would infer that proper care had not been used, and that negligence existed; another man equally sensible and equally impartial would infer that proper care had been used, and that there was no negligence. It is this class of cases and those akin to it that the law commits to the decision of a jury. Twelve men of the average of the community, comprising men of education and men of little education, men of learning and men whose learning consists only in what they have themselves seen and heard, the merchant, the mechanic, the farmer, the laborer; these sit together, consult, apply their separate experience of the affairs of life to the facts proven, and draw a unanimous conclusion. This average judgment thus given it is the great effort of the law to obtain. It is assumed that twelve men know more of the common affairs of life than does one man, that they can draw wiser and safer conclusions from admitted facts thus occurring than can a single judge.</p>

<p id="c0e2a776-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why? <i>Celotex</i> said that at the summary judgment stage, parties have the same burden of production they will have at trial. If parties have made good use of discovery, they will, by the time for summary judgment, have assembled all the evidence that they will use at trial. A summary judgment motion asks whether this evidence would be sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find in favor of the party with the burden of production. If not, the court should grant summary judgment against that party. So, if summary judgment is doing its job, all the cases where judgment as a matter of law might be granted will be screened out at the summary judgment stage, never reaching trial.</p>
<p id="c0e2a777-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not live in that perfect world of theory.

No, the Supreme Court has held, and that holding has the force of the Seventh Amendment behind it. The reasoning is that at the time the Amendment was adopted, courts permitted such post-verdict motion only as a renewal of a similar pre-verdict motion. Because the Amendment forbids “reexamin[ing]” a verdict except as was permitted at common law, a post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law standing alone would be unconstitutional.

Under Tenth Circuit law, a party that has failed to file a postverdict motion challenging the sufficiency of the evidence may nonetheless raise such a claim on appeal, so long as that party filed a Rule 50(a) motion prior to submission of the case to the jury. Notably, the only available relief in such a circumstance is a new trial.</p>

Accordingly, it vacated the jury’s judgment in favor of Unitherm and remanded for a new trial. We granted certiorari, and now reverse.</p>

<p id="c0e2ce9d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 sets forth the procedural requirements for challenging the sufficiency of the evidence in a civil jury trial and establishes two stages for such challenges—prior to submission of the case to the jury, and after the verdict and entry of judgment. Rule 50(a) allows a party to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence prior to submission of the case to the jury, and authorizes the district court to grant such motions at the court’s discretion. Rule 50(b), by contrast, sets forth the procedural requirements for renewing a sufficiency of the evidence challenge after the jury verdict and entry of judgment.</p>
<p id="c0e2ce9e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court has addressed the implications of a party’s failure to file a postverdict motion under Rule 50(b) on several occasions and in a variety of procedural contexts. <span title="639" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-639">p. 639</span>This Court has concluded that, “[i]n the absence of such a motion” an “appellate court [is] without power to direct the District Court to enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand.” Cone v. West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co., 330 U.S. 212, 218 (1947). This Court has similarly concluded that a party’s failure to file a Rule 50(b) motion deprives the appellate court of the power to order the entry of judgment in favor of that party where the district court directed the jury’s verdict, Globe Liquor Co. v. San Roman, 332 U.S. 571 (1948), and where the district court expressly reserved a party’s preverdict motion for a directed verdict and then denied that motion after the verdict was returned. A postverdict motion is necessary because “[d]etermination of whether a new trial should be granted or a judgment entered under Rule 50(b) calls for the judgment in the first instance of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses and has the feel of the case which no appellate printed transcript can impart.” Moreover, the “requirement of a timely application for judgment after verdict is not an idle motion” because it “is. . . . an essential part of the rule, firmly grounded in principles of fairness.”</p>
<p id="c0e2ce9f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The foregoing authorities lead us to reverse the judgment below. Respondent correctly points out that these authorities address whether an appellate court may enter judgment in the absence of a postverdict motion, as opposed to whether an appellate court may order a new trial (as the Federal Circuit did here). But this distinction is immaterial. This Court’s observations about the necessity of a postverdict motion under Rule 50(b), and the benefits of the district court’s input at that stage, apply with equal force whether a party is seeking judgment as a matter of law or simply a new trial. In <i>Cone,</i> this Court concluded that, because Rule 50(b) permits the district court to exercise its discretion to choose between ordering a new trial and entering judgment, its “appraisal of the bona fides of the claims asserted by the litigants is of great value in reaching a conclusion as to whether a <i>new trial</i> should be granted.” Similarly, this Court has determined that a party may only pursue on appeal a particular avenue of relief available under Rule 50(b), namely, the entry of judgment <i>or a new trial,</i> when that party has complied with the Rule’s filing requirements by requesting that particular relief below. . . . </p>

If judgment as a matter of law is granted and the appellate court holds that the evidence in fact was sufficient to go to the jury, an entire new trial must be had. If, on the other hand, the trial court submits the case to the jury, though it thinks the evidence insufficient, final determination of the case is expedited greatly. If the jury agrees with the court’s appraisal of the evidence, and returns a verdict for the party who moved for judgment as a matter of law, the case is at an end. If the jury brings in a different verdict, the trial court can grant a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.

For that reason Congress has preserved the federal appeals courts’ power to correct plain error, even though trial counsel’s omission will ordinarily give rise to a binding waiver. This is not a case, in my view, in which the authority of the appellate court is limited by an explicit statute or controlling rule. The spirit of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure favors preservation of a court’s power to avoid manifestly unjust results in exceptional cases. Moreover, we have an overriding duty to obey statutory commands that unambiguously express the intent of Congress even in areas such as procedure in which we may have special expertise.</p>

<p id="c0e31cd6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose two variations on the trial of <i>Peters v. Dodge</i> in Chapter 1—a suit for injuries resulting from an auto accident—assuming in both that the parties have made all appropriate pre-verdict motions. In the first variation, imagine that Peters produced a witness—a witness who was near the intersection when the accident occurred and testified that Dodge’s light was red. Further suppose that the trial judge thought the witness’s testimony was very weak: The witness happens to work with Peters’s mother, and so might be biased; moreover, she suffered from macular degeneration, making her ability to perceive the events suspect. Nevertheless, the jury returned a plaintiff’s verdict. In the second variation, suppose that unbiased and clear-sighted but contradictory witnesses testify about whether Peters or Dodge was in the wrong. In this version, however, the judge realizes after the jury has returned a defendant’s verdict that he failed to give a requested instruction on the substantive law, forgetting to make it clear that Peters had to show not only Dodge’s negligence, but that the negligence (rather, say than a preexisting injury) caused Peters’s medical condition.</p>

<p id="c0e31cdc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In both cases the procedural remedy is not judgment as a matter of law, but an order for a new trial, governed by Rule 59. Rule 59 does not specify the grounds for which a new trial may be ordered, stating only that the court may do so “for any reason for which a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action at law in federal court.” Do you see the Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment lurking behind that phrasing? A fairly well-developed body of common law suggests two principal reasons for granting new trials, one focusing on the procedure leading up to the verdict, the other on the correctness of the verdict itself.</p>

<p id="c0e31ce2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the trial was perfect, the judge may conclude that the result of that trial—the verdict—is unjustifiable. Probably the most common ground for granting a new trial is that the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence. Understanding this idea requires a glance back at judgments as a matter of law. Although both judgments as a matter of law and new trials result from verdicts with little or no evidentiary support, it is important to understand the difference between them. The consequences of each reflect their different rationales. In granting judgment as a matter of law, a court is saying that the winner of the verdict had no evidentiary support for at least one essential element of his claim or defense. Judgment as a matter of law results in an immediate entry of judgment for the loser of the verdict. By contrast, the grant of a new trial does not make a winner out of a loser; it merely begins the contest again. The standard is accordingly lower: As most courts would put it, a judge may grant a new trial when the verdict is “against the great weight of the evidence.” Those same courts would agree, however, that in considering whether to grant a new trial the trial judge may not simply decide how she would have voted as a juror. Where the standard lies between these two poles is harder to say.</p>

The term “discretion,” however, when invoked as a guide to judicial action, means a sound discretion, exercised with regard to what is right and in the interests of justice. And an appellate court is not bound to stay its hand and place its stamp of approval on a case when it feels that injustice may result. Quite to the contrary, it is definitely recognized in numerous decisions that an abuse of discretion is an exception to the rule that the granting or refusing of a new trial is not assignable as error.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0e34402-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus an appellate court must still rule upon the propriety of an order for a new trial, even though the grounds for reversal are exceedingly narrow. But before any rational decision can be made, the reviewing court must know what standards the trial judge is bound to apply when ruling upon a motion for a new trial. These standards necessarily vary according to the grounds urged in support of the new trial. There is, however, little authority on what standards are to be applied in ruling on a motion for new trial on the grounds that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence beyond the simple maxim that the trial judge has wide discretion. The few available <span title="645" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-645">p. 645</span>authorities are conflicting. Professor Moore concludes that while the trial judge has a responsibility for the result at least equal to that of the jury he should not set the verdict aside as contrary to the weight of the evidence and order a new trial simply because he would have come to a different conclusion if he were the trier of the facts. Professor Moore states in this connection:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0e36b13-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[S]ince the credibility of witnesses is peculiarly for the jury it is an invasion of the jury’s province to grant a new trial merely because the evidence was sharply in conflict. The trial judge, exercising a mature judicial discretion, should view the verdict in the overall setting of the trial; consider the character of the evidence and the complexity or simplicity of the legal principles which the jury was bound to apply to the facts; and abstain from interfering with the verdict unless it is quite clear that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result. The judge’s duty is essentially to see that there is no miscarriage of justice. If convinced that there has been then it is his duty to set the verdict aside; otherwise not.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0e36b14-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Moore’s views are logical and persuasive and buttressed by some decisional authority. . . . </p>
<p id="c0e36b15-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What we have stated demonstrates that there is no consensus of opinion as to the exact standards to be used by a trial court in granting a new trial and that the criteria to be employed by an appellate tribunal charged with reviewing the trial judge’s decision in this respect are equally indefinite. New trials granted because (1) a jury verdict is against the weight of the evidence may be sharply distinguished from (2) new trials ordered for other reasons: for example, evidence improperly admitted, prejudicial statements by counsel, an improper charge to the jury or newly discovered evidence. In the first instance given it is the jury itself which fails properly to perform the functions confided to it by law. In the latter instances something occurred in the course of the trial which resulted or which may have resulted in the jury receiving a distorted, incorrect, or an incomplete view of the operative facts, or some undesirable element obtruded itself into the proceedings creating a condition whereby the giving of a just verdict was rendered difficult or impossible. In the latter instances, (2), supra, the trial court delivered the jury from a possibly erroneous verdict arising from circumstances over which the jury had no control. Under these conditions there is no usurpation by the court of the prime function of the jury as the trier of the facts and the trial judge necessarily must be allowed wide discretion in granting or refusing a new trial.</p>
<p id="c0e36b16-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But where no undesirable or pernicious element has occurred or been introduced into the trial and the trial judge nonetheless grants a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, the trial judge in negating the jury’s verdict has, to some extent at least, substituted his judgment of the facts and the credibility of the witnesses for that of the jury. Such an action effects a denigration of the jury system and to the extent that new trials are granted the judge takes over, if he does not usurp, the prime function of the jury as the trier of the facts. It then becomes the duty of the appellate tribunal to exercise a closer degree of scrutiny and supervision than is the case where a new trial is granted because of some undesirable or pernicious influence obtruding into the trial. Such a close scrutiny is required in order to protect the litigants’ right to jury trial.</p>

An example of subject matter unfamiliar to a layman would be a case requiring a jury to pass upon the nature of an alleged newly discovered organic compound in an infringement action. A prime example of subject matter lying well within the comprehension of jurors is presented by the circumstances at bar.</p>
<p id="c0e36b18-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The subject matter of the litigation before us is simple and easily comprehended by any intelligent layman. The jury’s main function was to determine the veracity of the witnesses: i.e., what testimony should be believed. If Lind’s testimony and that of Mrs. Kennan, Kaufman’s secretary, was deemed credible, Lind presented a convincing, indeed an overwhelming case. We must conclude that the jury did believe this testimony and that the court below substituted its judgment for that of the jury on this issue and thereby abused its legal discretion.</p>

<p id="c0e36b1c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under [the traditional understanding of trial courts’ power to grant new trials] the only function of a reviewing court, once the trial court has ordered a new trial, is to see whether there can have been any basis in reason for the trial judge’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence and the injustice of the verdict. The majority do not challenge this view, though they do not state explicitly what their understanding of our role is.</p>
<p id="c0e36b1d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present record discloses a sharp conflict of testimony whether Kaufman, the metropolitan sales manager, ever promised plaintiff, his subordinate district manager, a 1% commission on all gross sales of agents working under plaintiff. There are several remarkable aspects of this alleged promise which could reasonably have influenced the trial judge on this decisive issue. This commission would have more than quadrupled plaintiff’s salary of $150 per week, making him much higher paid than his immediate superior, Kaufman, or any other company executive, except the president. No other sales manager or supervisor received any such commission at all. Moreover, after the alleged promise was made, month after month elapsed with no payment of the 1% commission or indication of any step to fulfill such an obligation. Yet plaintiff himself admits that he made no formal demand for or inquiry about the large obligation for several years, and said nothing even informally about it to anyone for many months save for an occasional passing verbal inquiry said to have been addressed to Kaufman. The trial court may have reasoned that the amount said to have been promised was so abnormally large and plaintiff’s concern about nonpayment so unnaturally small as to make it incredible that the promise ever was made. In addition, the very vagueness of the alleged promise and the absence of any mention of time in it may have increased the incredulity of the judge who heard the evidence.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0e39234-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Lind</i> opinion addresses three issues: (1) what standard the trial court should apply in setting aside verdicts as being against the weight of the evidence, (2) how the trial court should apply that standard to the case at hand, and (3) what standard the appellate court should apply in reviewing new trial rulings. How does the <i>Lind</i> opinion resolve each of these issues?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0e39235-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Lind</i> opinion also illustrates another part of the relationship between directed verdicts and orders for new trials. Notice that defendant, having lost the verdict, made both motions, and the trial court granted both.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0e39236-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why? If the trial judge granted defendant judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) that would end the case. Why bother also ruling on a motion for a new trial? Rule 50(c) contains the answer, permitting a party making a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law to make a conditional motion for a new trial, and requiring the court to rule on that conditional motion if she grants the Rule 50(b) motion. This conditional ruling comes into play only if “the judgment [notwithstanding the verdict] is later vacated or reversed.” <i>Lind</i> illustrates the need for such a conditional ruling because the judgment as a matter of law was in fact reversed. Without Rule 50(c), the defendant would have had to return to the trial court and, perhaps some years after the trial, make its motion for a new trial, long after perhaps-critical details had faded from the trial judge’s memory. Rule 50(c) allows the trial judge to rule on all post-trial motions with the case still fresh in mind and allows the appellate court to consider all of them at once—as it did in <i>Lind</i>. You can see the U.S. Supreme Court endorsing this reasoning toward the end of the opinion in <i>Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc</i>. (supra page 637).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0e39237-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice that while the grant of a judgment as a matter of law constitutes a final judgment from which an appeal may be taken, the grant of a new trial, standing alone, does not create a final judgment—there will be no final judgment until after completion of the new trial. Accordingly, a party cannot <span title="648" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-648">p. 648</span>appeal the grant of a new trial until after the second trial has occurred!

</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0e39238-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose a jury returns a defense verdict. The judge, believing that the evidence strongly favored the plaintiff, orders a new trial. The second jury agrees with the first. Should the judge order still a third trial or simply conclude that he was wrong about the weight of the evidence? Because the new trial order is not appealable, the length of such a sequence is theoretically indefinite. Worry not: In practice, one of four things is likely to happen: The judge may finally get a jury that agrees with him, or the judge may decide that the juries were right and he was wrong. If neither of these occurs, the parties may well decide to settle rather than continue pouring money into repeated trials. Or, finally, defendant might eventually get an appellate court to grant a writ of mandamus (see infra page 689) to put him out of his misery.</p></li>

<p id="c0e3923b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Up to now, we have dealt with situations in which grants of new trials involved retrying the entire case. Consider a judge who concludes that the jury reasonably could have reached a verdict for the plaintiff but that its damage calculations are unreasonably low or high. May the judge grant a new trial limited to the issue of damages? The answer is yes, though the problems involved in reaching that answer are considerable.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="c0e3923c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">

<p id="c0e3b94e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider the logical underpinnings of such a ruling. To be prepared to order a new trial limited to the issue of damages, the judge must be convinced that whatever influences led the jury astray on damages did not infect the judgment on liability as well. Take, for example, a verdict for the plaintiff combined with clearly insufficient damages. Can the judge be certain that the low award did not reflect considerable jury uncertainty that the plaintiff should recover at all—uncertainty that should have been reflected in a verdict for the defendant? The same doubt can exist in the case of clearly excessive damages; a jury passionately disposed toward the plaintiff regarding damages may have been so influenced on the issue of liability as well.</p>
<p id="c0e3b94f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet courts do order such partial new trials. Pingatore v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., 419 F.2d 1138 (6th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 928 (1970), serves as an example. A rat leapt on and bit plaintiff’s knee while she was leaving a department store’s premises. She developed complications leading to partial paralysis in an arm and leg. Testimony divided over whether the damage was attributable to the treatment for the bite (a series of rabies inoculations), to “conversion hysteria” or “psychosis,” or to “malingering.” After a trial in which the plaintiff’s attorney ranted and swore at the defendant corporation, the jury awarded plaintiff $126,000 in damages and $25,000 to her husband. The court of appeals reversed <span title="649" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-649">p. 649</span>the judgment on account of the plaintiff’s attorney’s misbehavior. But, without explaining more than that “there is substantial evidence to support the verdict of the jury on the question of liability,” the court limited the new trial to damages. Why was liability so clear? Because it was obvious that the plaintiff should get <i>something</i> for being bitten by a rat?</p>

<p id="c0e3b952-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Instead of ordering a new trial on damages, could the <i>Pingatore</i> court simply have reduced the amount of the damage award to one it thought reasonable? The answer is yes—under some circumstances. In such an action, known as <i>remittitur</i>, the judge orders a new trial unless the plaintiff agrees to accept reduced damages. Its damage-increasing analogue is <i>additur</i>. Both involve many of the problems inherent in the partial new trial as well as some special difficulties.</p>
<p id="c0e3b953-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the jury renders a verdict that is arguably excessive, the trial judge faces several questions. These questions apply, in reverse, to additur, the less common of the two devices. Essentially, the questions are: First, when should one grant such a reduction (or addition) in damages? And, second, how does one calculate the amount?</p>
<p id="c0e3b954-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider the choice to which the grant of remittitur puts a plaintiff. Assume a verdict of $150,000 for plaintiff that the court orders remitted to $75,000. If plaintiff refuses the remittitur, the consequence is, of course, that the court will grant a new trial. The Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff must get a choice between a new trial and accepting reduced compensatory damages. Hetzel v. Prince William County, 523 U.S. 208 (1998). What about punitive damages? In several cases (see Chapter 5), the Supreme Court has held that due process requires judicial scrutiny and reduction of some punitive damage awards. A number of courts have found that this line of cases overcomes what would otherwise be a Seventh Amendment requirement that the court give plaintiff a choice between reduced punitive damages and a new trial—plaintiff simply has to accept the reduced punitives. E.g., Johansen v. Combustion Engineering, Inc., 170 F.3d 1320 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>
<p id="c0e3b955-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose the plaintiff accepts the remittitur of compensatory damages. May she condition her acceptance on a right to appeal? If not, may the plaintiff at least raise the matter if the defendant appeals the remitted verdict? The Supreme Court has blocked the attempt of lower courts to permit appeals from conditionally accepted verdicts. According to the Court, the plaintiff had a choice: Accept the remittitur or prepare for a new trial. Donovan v. Penn Shipping Co., 429 U.S. 648, 649 (1977).</p>
<p id="c0e3b956-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Are remittitur and additur constitutional? Some years ago, the Supreme Court held that additur violates the Seventh Amendment but that remittitur does not. The theory was that remittitur simply involves modifying a decision actually made by a jury—lopping off the excess—while additur involves making an award that no jury has ever made. See Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 483 (1935). Critics have suggested that this is a distinction without a difference, but it is still the law in federal courts. Many states permit additur as well as remittitur.</p>

Recall that the second half of the Seventh Amendment provides: “[N]o fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.” What does that mean? At a minimum, as we have already seen, it prevents a judge from overturning a jury verdict merely because she, as a juror, would have voted differently than the actual jury did. How much further does it restrict judicial control over jury verdicts?</p>

From these interviews it appears that the jurors misunderstood the jury instructions. Suppose the jurors further say that they would have decided the case for the losing party if they had understood the instructions. Suppose the jurors go one step further, and each executes a sworn affidavit to that effect. Should the court grant judgment notwithstanding the verdict or grant a new trial to ensure a rational result under the applicable law?</p>

The court voided the verdict because, in the court’s own words, the jury “completely disregarded the Court’s instructions.” Peterson timely filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court did not grant. The case was re-tried in June 1996, and ended in a jury verdict in favor of Wilson, rejecting Peterson’s claims. . . . </p>

<p id="c0e3e076-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Peterson is well educated, well trained, and widely experienced in his field of concentration, which is grant administration for institutions of higher education. When Peterson joined TSU in 1983 he assumed responsibility for administering grants, principally Title III grants. In addition, he was in charge of student affairs and was responsible for determining the residency status of foreign students. Peterson also supervised finances of the university and was in charge of Institutional Research. As Title III Director, Peterson generally reported directly to the Vice President for Academic Affairs: first Clarkson, then Moore, and eventually, Wilson. The programs supported by Title III grants included faculty development, equipment purchases, and institutional research, providing millions of dollars annually for expenditures at TSU. . . . </p>

<p id="c0e3e078-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The termination letter of January 3, 1991, from Wilson to Peterson purported to outline nine items constituting “cause” for the firing, each of which was set forth in a report prepared and submitted on request by one Joyce Deyon with whom, it turned out, Wilson never conferred after receiving the report. Wilson testified that he accepted the report and made his judgment based on it.</p>
<p id="c0e3e079-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury heard testimony and saw documents which, if believed—as the jury apparently did—methodically refuted or explained away each of the nine purported causes for termination and revealed that Wilson did not even understand some of the items. The jury also heard evidence which, if credited, was sufficient to support a conclusion that the termination and its purported causes were pretext intended to cover Wilson’s retaliation and desire to accomplish his actual or implied threats of <span title="652" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-652">p. 652</span>getting rid of Peterson and replacing him with a grant director who would be more of a team player, i.e., would be more amenable to funding equipment purchases and job creations for “friends” of the higher-ups in the TSU administration with grant money.</p>
<p id="c0e4068a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That the jury unquestionably credited the testimony and documentation supporting Peterson’s version of the facts and rejected Wilson’s is confirmed by the “Yes” answer to Interrogatory No. I-A, “Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that Dr. Bobby Wilson acted arbitrarily and capriciously in terminating Dr. Peterson?” In the interrogatory that followed, the jury awarded Peterson $152,235 in lost pay and benefits, and $35,000 for past and future mental anguish.</p>

<p id="c0e4068d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court’s succinct but cryptic, three-sentence explanation for granting a new trial demonstrates beyond question that, following the verdict, the court impermissibly met with and interrogated the jurors outside the presence of the parties and their respective counsel, and then proceeded to act in direct reliance on the jurors’ comments as though they constituted newly discovered evidence of a kind that the court could properly consider. It was not. The conclusion is inescapable that, in impeaching the jury’s verdict in this case, the district court relied on information obtained from the jurors in the court’s post-verdict, ex parte meeting with them and that, by definition, any information thus obtained had to come directly from their internal deliberations qua jurors.</p>

<p id="c0e40690-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict. . . . , a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury’s deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other juror’s mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict. . . . or concerning the juror’s mental processes in connection therewith, except that a juror may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury’s attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to the jury’s attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror.

<p id="c0e40691-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The landmark Supreme Court case on this issue is <i>Tanner v. United States</i>.

Exxon Corp</i>. that receiving testimony from the jurors after they have returned their verdict, for the purpose of ascertaining that the jury misunderstood its instructions, is absolutely prohibited by F.R.E. 606(b). We underscored that holding by noting that “the legislative history of the rule unmistakably points to the conclusion that Congress made a conscious decision to disallow juror testimony as to the jurors’ mental processes or fidelity to the court’s instructions.” What is pellucid here, from the court’s own unequivocal and unambiguous words, is that the jurors’ statements to the court related directly to matters that transpired in the jury room, that these matters comprehended the mental processes of the jurors in their deliberations on the case, and that the jurors’ statements formed the foundation of the court’s impeachment of the verdict grounded in the jury’s lack of “fidelity to the court’s instructions.” We cannot conceive of an example more explicitly violative of <i>Robles</i>. . . . </p>
<p id="c0e40692-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The Court of Appeals concluded that the district court did not find that the verdict was against the great weight of the evidence and that, even if it had, such a decision was contrary to the record.] We are thus left with no choice but to reverse the district court’s grant of a new trial, vacate the court’s judgment rendered on the basis of the jury verdict in the second trial, and reinstate the results of the first trial. We therefore remand this case to the district court for entry of judgment in favor of Peterson and against Wilson in the principal sum of $187,235 ($152,235 for lost pay and benefits and $35,000 for past and future mental anguish), and for the assessment of appropriate interest and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by Peterson in both trials and on appeal.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0e42daf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Distinguish <i>Peterson</i> from <i>In re Beverly Hills Fire Litigation</i>, noted at page 624.

The appellate court held it an abuse of discretion not to grant a new trial. Why is it erroneous to grant a new trial when a juror misunderstands instructions and erroneous not to grant a new trial when a juror performs such experiments? Explain the distinction.</p></li>

<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0e454c4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One can explain Federal Rule of Evidence 606 cynically: Too many jury verdicts would fall if we delved into jury deliberations deeply.</p></li>

As you have already seen, if summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law are operating properly, only close cases—cases that could rationally be decided either way—will go to the jury. In such cases, any verdict should be sustainable. And, some would add, in such cases the soft variables that constitute the jury’s sense of justice should come into play, even when those variables are hard to justify from the lofty plane of rationalism. By preventing too close an inquiry into a jury’s decision processes, one allows these considerations some free play.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0e454c6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, one can justify the Rule as a matter of court administration. Many people are reluctant to serve on a jury: It disrupts lives and schedules and involves them in making difficult decisions. If one added to these inconveniences the possibility that one could be questioned by a disappointed loser about jury deliberations, it might become very difficult to fill jury boxes.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0e454cd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The U.S. Supreme Court recently faced a collision between Rule 606 and the apparent racial prejudice of a juror. In Peña-Rodriguez v. Colorado, 580 U.S. ___ (2017), the Court ruled that a juror’s clear expression of racial stereotype as a basis for voting to convict required that a court allow a fellow juror to testify as to that bias in spite of Rule 606.

<li class=""><p id="c0e47be0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a special verdict the jury does not render a general verdict at all. Instead, it answers a series of questions about the evidence: “Was the defendant negligent? If so, did the defendant’s negligence cause the plaintiff’s injuries? If so, was the plaintiff also negligent? If so, did the plaintiff’s negligence in some part contribute to his injuries?” When the jury has answered all the questions—or all those that are necessary—it delivers them as the verdict. In a general verdict with interrogatories, the jury renders a general verdict but also answers particular questions.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0e47be1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The concept of the special verdict and general verdict with interrogatories is simple: One gives the jurors a road map of the relevant legal issues, helping them to focus on each question as (and if) it becomes relevant.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0e47be2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The practice surrounding these procedures has been much less happy. Jurors can become confused by the questions. The nightmare outcome—one too often realized in the cases—is that juries give inconsistent answers. In one notorious case, the jury said (a) that the defendant was negligent but (b) that it was impossible for the defendant to have foreseen any danger from a particular condition on its property—that condition being the only way in which the jury could have found the defendant negligent! Gallick v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, 372 U.S. 108 (1963). As a consequence of these problems, judges, in whose discretion the decision to allow a special verdict lies, often avoid them.</p></li>

The one thing most civil trials are not is dramatic. Witnesses can change their stories and an occasional surprise will appear, but a well-prepared civil trial where both sides have made effective use of discovery will not look like a “Perry Mason” episode.</p>

In drama, the trial is the end of the road: The winners rejoice; the losers slink away in shame or anger. In litigation, the trial is a rare event, but even when it occurs, it may not be the end. Perhaps because trials are so rare, parties who have been unable to resolve their differences beforehand may not do so just because a judge or jury has announced a winner.

<p id="c0e4ca24-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q1.</b>  C is the only correct response; it is correct because some states permit “peremptory” recusal of judges. A is wrong because 28 U.S.C. §455(b)(2) (and analogous state law provisions) requires recusal only when the lawyer has served as counsel “in the matter” in controversy—meaning this very case. B is (probably) wrong unless the daughter’s employment gave the judge knowledge of disputed, material facts. D is wrong because except in the rare case in which the judge becomes so embroiled with the parties that she loses perspective, recusal is required only when biases preexist the litigation itself.</p>
<p id="c0e4ca25-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q2.</b>  A is the only correct response. Rule 50(a) requires a motion by a party. B is wrong for the same reason: Defendant has not made a Rule 50 motion. C is wrong because for a federal court to grant a Rule 50(b) motion, a party must have made a pre-verdict Rule 50(a) motion.</p>
<p id="c0e4ca26-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q3.</b>  A is the only correct response. A new trial is in order because there was a procedural mistake—the failure to charge on the burden of persuasion; Rule 59(d) permits a judge to make such an order either on her own motion or on a motion by a party. B is wrong because both parties have presented conflicting evidence on all the elements of the claim. C is wrong because Rule 59 permits a new trial order. D is wrong because Rule 59, unlike Rule 50, permits the judge to order a new trial on her own motion.</p>
<p id="c0e4ca27-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4.</b>  B and C are the correct responses. B is correct because the question specifies that both sides have presented conflicting evidence on all the elements of <span title="659" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-659">p. 659</span>the claim, and judges are not permitted to resolve questions of weight of the evidence or credibility of witnesses in ruling on directed verdicts. C is correct because a judge can grant a new trial if the verdict is against “the great weight of the evidence.”</p>
<p id="c0e4ca28-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q5.</b>  C is the correct response. A is wrong because, although Rule 50 allows a motion at such time it does not limit a motion to that time. B is wrong for the same reason.</p>
<p id="c0e4ca29-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q6.</b>  Only B is a correct response—this brings “outside” information, not subject to evidentiary objections or cross-examination, into the deliberations. A is wrong because one would have to learn this from a juror—who under Fed. R. Evid. 606(b) cannot testify about jury deliberations. C is wrong for two reasons: As with B it would be excluded under 606(b); moreover, this is just the sort of common life experience we expect jurors to bring to their deliberations.</p><span title="660" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-660">p. 660</span>

Juries were usually delighted to be spared the task of deliberating, but every so often one balked, and refused to return the requested verdict, leading in the rare case to the court’s holding them in contempt until they complied. Rule 50 eliminates such episodes and changes its terminology to conform to actual practice.</p></div>
