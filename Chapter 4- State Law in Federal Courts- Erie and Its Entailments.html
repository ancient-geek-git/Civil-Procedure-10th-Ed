<div class="cc-section epub-section epub-anyhead" id="c09cc4d0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">
<p id="c09cc4d1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recall the theme of this section—the constitutional framework for U.S. litigation. The two preceding chapters have illustrated the two principal means by which the Constitution creates that framework: It limits the powers of states over defendants, and it enumerates (thereby limiting) the powers of the federal courts. The first limitation appears in the doctrines of personal jurisdiction, the second in those of federal subject matter jurisdiction. The Constitution thus requires state courts to share power with one another and with a federal judiciary. This chapter explores an entailment of that shared power: How does the Constitution ensure that these two court systems respect each other’s spheres of power?</p>
<p id="c09cc4d2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question arises because state and federal courts not only share power, but they exercise overlapping jurisdiction. For example, under modern understandings of personal jurisdiction, several different states—and the state and federal courts in those states—may have jurisdiction to hear a case against a particular defendant. Similarly, state courts can hear cases arising under federal law, and federal courts, sitting in diversity, can hear cases that arise under state law. Under these circumstances both state and federal courts frequently face a question that arises from this overlapping jurisdiction: What law applies to the case before us?</p>
<p id="c09cc4d3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="256" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-256">p. 256</span>Consider a fairly simple case: Al (from Arizona) sues Barb (from Texas) on a claim for an allegedly unpaid loan for $100,000; Barb has substantial contacts with Arizona, so she could be sued in a state court either there or in Texas. Moreover, as you have seen in the preceding chapter, the case would also fall under the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts and so could be filed in federal courts in Arizona and Texas. Suppose that Barb asserts as a defense that the loan violated the lending laws of Texas. Whose law would apply?</p>
<p id="c09cc4d4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This question would arise in whichever court heard the case, and it opens a broad field of inquiry known as <i>choice of law</i> or <i>conflict of laws. Erie</i>, an opinion from which this chapter takes its title, involves a subset of these questions: When a federal court sits in diversity jurisdiction or exercises supplemental jurisdiction, what law does it apply?</p>
<p id="c09cc4d5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This question, though phrased narrowly, opens the door onto a much larger set of questions about the relations of state and federal courts and of constitutional interpretation. Speaking about part of this problem, one distinguished commentator has written, “No issue in the whole field of federal jurisprudence has been more difficult.  . . . ” Wright, Federal Courts 368. This chapter will seek to explain why someone might take that view—but it also seeks to make the problems much less difficult than this quotation implies.</p>

<p id="c09cebea-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To understand how the issue arises, one needs a brief historical perspective. The first Judiciary Act provided for federal diversity jurisdiction and also contained a section now codified at 28 U.S.C. §1652 and known as the Rules of Decision Act:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c09cebeb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The laws of the several states, except where the Constitution or Acts of Congress ­otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decisions in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply.</p>
</div>
<p id="c09cebec-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On its face, one might think that that statute, in effect since the earliest days of the Republic, would resolve the question. Since diversity cases are in federal court only because of the parties’ citizenship, there isn’t any federal law to apply, so one might think that such cases would be “cases where they [i.e., state laws] apply.” The story is not that simple, however, because people have disagreed sharply about what “the laws of the several states” means, and beyond that what “law” means.</p>
<p id="c09cebed-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These issues emerged in Swift v. Tyson, 41 U.S. 1 (1842), the leading pre-<i>Erie</i> case, which <i>Erie</i> overrules. <i>Swift</i> involved a “bill of exchange,” a halfway step between a promissory note and a modern check or credit card. With promissory <span title="257" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-257">p. 257</span>notes, there are numerous defenses available to anyone sued for breach; with their modern analogues those defenses are much more limited. The substantive issue in <i>Swift</i> was how many defenses could be asserted and thus how much like an ordinary contract and how much like a modern check or credit card the bill of exchange was. Procedurally and jurisprudentially (the aspects with which we shall be concerned), the issue was which law applied to the substantive question. <i>Swift</i> was a diversity case filed in a federal court sitting in New York. New York courts had previously spoken on the substantive issue, ruling that bills were subject to a number of defenses. Were these New York cases part of “the laws” of that state and thus binding on the federal district court? No, held the U.S. Supreme Court in an opinion by Justice Joseph Story, who not only served on the U.S. Supreme Court from 1811-1845 but also taught law and wrote nine influential treatises—all while serving on the Court!</p>
<p id="c09cebee-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Story’s opinion, which, according to the dissent, reached beyond what was necessary for the decision, said that the New York precedents were not “laws”; thus, the federal courts sitting in diversity were free to ignore them:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c09cebef-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But, admitting the doctrine [concerning which defenses could be asserted] to be fully settled in New York, it remains to be considered whether it is obligatory upon this court if it differs from the principles established in the general commercial law. It is observable that the Courts of New York do not found their decisions upon this point upon any local statute, or positive, fixed, or ancient usage; but they deduce the doctrine from the general principles of commercial law. It is, however, contended that [the Rules of Decision Act] furnishes a rule obligatory on this Court to follow the decisions of state tribunals in all cases to which they apply. . . . In order to maintain the argument, it is essential. . . . that the word “laws” [in the Rules of Decision Act] includes within the scope of its meaning the decisions of local tribunals. In the ordinary use of language it will hardly be contended that the decisions of Courts constitute laws. They are at most evidence of what the laws are; and are not themselves laws. . . . The laws of a state are more usually understood to mean the rules and enactments promulgated by the legislative authority thereof. . . . [The Court said it would be bound by state statutes and by state judge-made law on matters of peculiarly “local” matters but not on more general topics.] Undoubtedly, the decisions of the local tribunals upon such subjects are entitled to, and will receive, the most deliberate attention and respect of this Court; but they cannot furnish positive rules on conclusive authority. . . . </p>
</div>
<p id="c09cebf0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Swift</i> went on to reach a conclusion different from that reached by the New York courts on the issue at stake.</p>
<p id="c09cebf1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the ensuing century, <i>Swift</i> came to be seen by many not only as momentous, but also as pernicious, not because of its holding on the negotiability of bills of exchange, but because of its treatment of state law. For many federal courts, <i>Swift</i> became a charter of judicial independence, a declaration that they could ignore state case law. Often decisions in the <i>Swift</i> line of cases seemed to favor business interests; one elaborate study argued, “As the number of industrial tort suits continued to increase [from the 1890s on] and Americans endured the most severe depression <span title="258" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-258">p. 258</span>in their nation’s history, the Supreme Court [used diversity jurisdiction to] shape[] law in ways that enhanced the litigation position of corporate defendants.” Edward A. Purcell, Jr., Litigation and Inequality: Federal Diversity Jurisdiction in Industrial America, 1870-1958, 245 (Oxford 1992).</p>
<p id="c09d1302-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice that <i>Swift</i> reached its conclusion as an interpretation of the Rules of Decision Act, which Congress could have amended during the years that followed. Congress did not amend the Act. The next step in the story took matters out of Congress’s hands.</p>

<p id="c09d1305-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Erie</i> doctrine arose from a relatively simple dispute. On Thursday, July 26, 1934, Harry Tompkins visited his mother-in-law’s house in Hughestown, a village of 2,800 people in northeastern Pennsylvania. He received a ride part of the way home and walked the remaining distance along the railroad tracks of the Erie Railroad, keeping several feet between himself and the tracks. A train passed, and an open door on a refrigerator car struck him and knocked him partially under the train. His right arm was severed. After recovering from his injuries, he sought a lawyer and found 27-year-old Bernard Nemeroff. Although <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> was generally understood to benefit corporations, in this case, Nemeroff and his partner, 21-year-old Aaron Danzig, believed that they could turn <i>Swift</i> to Tompkins’s strategic advantage if they sued the railroad in the federal District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>
<p id="c09d1306-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under Pennsylvania law, for whose application the railroad’s lawyer argued, Tompkins was a trespasser and the railroad was therefore liable only for “wanton” negligence, a finding unlikely given the facts. The judge, relying on the freedom given by <i>Swift v. Tyson</i>, instead instructed the jury according to the “general law,” that the railroad was liable even if it was guilty of only “ordinary” negligence. The jury returned a verdict for Tompkins in the amount of $30,000 (almost $500,000 in 2019 dollars). The railroad appealed, but the Second Circuit upheld Tompkins’s verdict relying on <i>Swift v. Tyson</i>. The railroad then sought a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court. In the meantime the railroad asked Justice Cardozo to stay the judgment until the Supreme Court could consider the certiorari petition, and Justice Cardozo obliged. The railroad then made Tompkins a settlement offer—$7,500 plus the withdrawal of its certiorari petition—but Danzig and Nemeroff talked him out of accepting and then hid him from the railroad’s lawyers.</p>
<p id="c09d1307-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court granted certiorari, even though it rarely did so in negligence cases. On April 25, 1938, the Supreme Court decided the case in one of the last opinions written by Justice Brandeis. The decision went unnoticed until Justice Stone wrote privately to a <i>New York Times</i> journalist, calling to his attention “the most important opinion since I have been on the court.”</p>

<p id="c09d3a1d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Louis D. Brandeis is remembered as much for his career before appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court as for his work as a Justice. Successful both as a law reformer and as a private practitioner, Brandeis liked to describe himself as “counsel to the situation,” a concept that has drawn both high praise for the idea of the lawyer as problem-solver, and criticism for its suggestion that he was prepared to lay aside the interests of some clients to pursue his own idea of justice. Indeed, some of those on the losing side of Brandeis’s legal practice bitterly opposed his nomination by President Wilson to the Supreme Court, and six months of wrangling preceded his confirmation in 1916. Best known during his life for cases upholding social legislation, Brandeis wrote <i>Erie</i> as one of his last opinions for the Court. In rejecting a statutory basis for the holding in <i>Erie</i>, Brandeis departed from a general principle he otherwise espoused—deciding cases on non-constitutional grounds if possible, a principle that has come to be known as “the <i>Ashwander</i> principle,” after Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).</p>
<p id="c09d3a1e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice that the opinion opens portentously: “The question for decision is whether the oft-challenged doctrine of <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> shall now be disapproved.  . . . ” That “question” might have come as a shock to the parties, since neither the railroad nor Tompkins had raised or addressed it in their briefs (the railroad simply argued that the law of trespass was sufficiently “local” that under <i>Swift</i> the federal courts should follow it).</p>

Doubt was repeatedly expressed as to the correctness of the construction given [the Act], and as to the soundness of the rule which it introduced. But it was the more recent research of a competent scholar, who examined the original document, which established that the construction given to it by the Court was erroneous; and that the purpose of the section was merely to make certain that, in all matters except those in which some federal law is controlling, the federal courts exercising jurisdiction in diversity of citizenship cases would apply as their rules of decision the law of the State, unwritten as well as written.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1013D_d543b178-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1013D_d543b178-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">5</a></span></p>
<p id="c09d6139-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Criticism of the doctrine became widespread after the decision of <i>Black &amp; White Taxicab Co. v. Brown &amp; Yellow Taxicab Co</i>. There, Brown and Yellow, a Kentucky corporation owned by Kentuckians, and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, also a Kentucky corporation, wished that the former should have the exclusive privilege of soliciting passenger and baggage transportation at the Bowling Green, Kentucky, railroad station; and that the Black and White, a competing Kentucky corporation, should be prevented from interfering with that privilege. Knowing that such a contract would be void under the common law of Kentucky, it was arranged that the Brown and Yellow reincorporate under the law of Tennessee, and that the contract with the railroad should be executed there. The suit was then brought by the Tennessee corporation in the federal court for Western Kentucky to enjoin competition by the Black and White; an injunction issued by the District Court was sustained by the Court of Appeals; and this Court, citing many decisions in which the doctrine of <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> had been applied, affirmed the decree.</p>
<p id="c09d613a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Second</i>. Experience in applying the doctrine of <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> had revealed its defects, political and social; and the benefits expected to flow from the rule did not accrue. Persistence of state courts in their own opinions on questions of common law prevented uniformity; and the impossibility of discovering a satisfactory line of demarcation between the province of general law and that of local law developed a new well of uncertainties.</p>
<p id="c09d613b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, the mischievous results of the doctrine had become apparent.

Tyson</i> introduced grave discrimination by non-citizens against citizens. It made rights enjoyed under the unwritten “general law” vary according to whether enforcement was sought in the state or in the federal court; and the privilege of selecting the court in which the right should be determined was conferred upon the non-citizen. Thus, the doctrine rendered impossible equal protection of the law. In attempting to promote uniformity of law throughout the United States, the doctrine had prevented uniformity in the administration of the law of the State.</p>
<p id="c09d613c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The discrimination resulting became in practice far-reaching.

<p id="c09d613d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In part the discrimination resulted from the wide range of persons held entitled to avail themselves of the federal rule by resort to the diversity of citizenship jurisdiction. . . . </p>

And whether the law of the State shall be declared by its Legislature in a statute or by its highest court in a decision is not a matter of federal concern. There is no federal general common law. Congress has no power to declare substantive rules of common law applicable in a State whether they be local in their nature or “general,” be they commercial law or a part of the law of torts. And no clause in the Constitution purports to confer such a power upon the federal courts. As stated by Mr. Justice Field when protesting in Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co. v. Baugh, 149 U.S. 368, 401, against ignoring the Ohio common law of fellow-servant liability: “[N]otwithstanding the frequency with which the doctrine [of <i>Swift v. Tyson</i>] has been reiterated, there stands, as a perpetual protest against its repetition, the constitution of the United States, which recognizes and preserves the autonomy and independence of the states,—independence in their legislative and independence in their judicial departments. Supervision over either the legislative or the judicial action of the states is in no case permissible except as to matters by the constitution specifically authorized or delegated to the United States. Any interference with either, except as thus permitted, is an invasion of the authority of the state, and, to that extent, a denial of its independence.”</p>
<p id="c09d6140-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fallacy underlying the rule declared in <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> is made clear by Mr. Justice Holmes. The doctrine rests upon the assumption that there is “a transcendental body of law outside of any particular State but obligatory within it unless and until changed by statute,” that federal courts have the power to use their judgment as to what the rules of common law are; and that in the federal courts “the parties are entitled to an independent judgment on matters of general law”:</p>

<p id="c09d6142-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus the doctrine of <i>Swift v.

We merely declare that in applying the doctrine this Court and the lower courts have invaded rights which in our opinion are reserved by the Constitution to the several States.</p>

The defendant contended that by the common law of Pennsylvania as declared by its highest court in Falchetti v. Pennsylvania R.

In support of their respective contentions the parties discussed and cited many decisions of the Supreme Court of the State. The Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the question of liability is one of general law; and on that ground declined to decide the issue of state law. As we hold this was error, the judgment is reversed and the case remanded to it for further proceedings in conformity with our opinion.</p>

<p id="c09d6147-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To decide the case now before us and to “disapprove” the doctrine of <i>Swift v.

<p id="c09d6148-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “unconstitutional” course referred to in the majority opinion is apparently the ruling in <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> that the supposed omission of Congress to legislate as to the effect of decisions leaves federal courts free to interpret general law for themselves. I am not at all sure whether, in the absence of federal statutory direction, federal courts would be compelled to follow state decisions. There was sufficient doubt about the matter in 1789 to induce the first Congress to legislate. . . . If the opinion commits this Court to the position that the Congress is without power to declare what rules of substantive law shall govern the federal courts, that conclusion also seems questionable. The line between procedural and substantive law is hazy but no one doubts federal power over procedure. The Judiciary Article and the “necessary and proper” clause of Article One may fully authorize legislation, such as this section of the Judiciary Act.</p>

The U.S. Supreme Court seems to assume that if the tort law of Pennsylvania applied to the facts of the case, the railroad would owe Tompkins only the duty of refraining from wanton or willful negligence. Tompkins had a better chance of preserving his verdict if the railroad owed him a higher degree of care. Tompkins’s lawyers pointed to a different source of law, one requiring such a higher standard of care. What was that source?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c09d8862-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet the opinion states that the Court is overruling <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> on constitutional grounds. Notice that the opinion cites no particular phrase or clause of the Constitution, a somewhat unusual omission for a case otherwise insisting that the Constitution provides the basis for its decision.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09d8863-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider two sentences from the opinion, at the start of the part labeled “Third”: “Except in matters governed by the Federal Constitution or by Acts of Congress, the law to be applied in any case is the law of the State. And whether the law of the State shall be declared by its Legislature in a statute or by its highest court in a decision is not a matter of federal concern.” Do those sentences, which some have described as “structural federalism,” explain how the decision has constitutional roots? The generally accepted answer is that respect for states includes respect for a state’s decision to give part of its lawmaking powers to courts rather than to legislatures. If a state is content to have its judges make some of its laws in the process of adjudicating cases, the federal government—including federal courts—must respect that decision. Those propositions, the argument continues, are inherent in <span title="264" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-264">p. 264</span>the federal structure of government, a structure expressed throughout the Constitution, and incorporated by allusion in the Tenth Amendment (since the Constitution did not strip the state courts of lawmaking powers, they retain them). Does that explanation illuminate the idea that <i>Erie</i> is a constitutional decision even though the opinion does not rest on any particular clause of the Constitution?</p></li>

<p id="c09d886b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Erie</i> says that “there is no federal general common law.” One can easily understand this sentence to mean more than it does. <i>Erie</i> holds only that “<i>general</i>” federal common law may not displace that of the states in areas in which the Constitution rests lawmaking power in the states. But—confined to its proper sphere, federal common law continues to flourish: Think of the hundreds of federal causes of action, in which courts must supplement general statutory or constitutional principles with judge-made common law. For example, Congress granted federal jurisdiction over a broad area of labor law—without providing any guiding substantive principles. The Court held that Congress thereby intended to give federal courts common law powers in this area. Textile Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448 (1957). In other fields both state and federal courts rely almost entirely on common law. For example, both state and federal courts consult common law to decide on the principles of former adjudication, which you will study in Chapter 11.</p>
<p id="c09d886c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In diversity cases, it will be clear that the only source of substantive law must be that of the states, and <i>Erie</i> commands federal courts to respect that law, whether made by <span title="265" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-265">p. 265</span>legislatures or courts. But the <i>Erie</i> principle will also apply whenever states supply the governing law, regardless of the basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction. For example, suppose a federal civil rights claim of employment discrimination is brought in federal district court, with additional state law claims for breach of contract and state employment statutes, brought under the federal supplemental jurisdiction statute explored in Chapter 3. There’s no diversity in sight, but the principles of <i>Erie</i> still apply: The federal courts will look to state law, including state common law, in deciding the state law claims.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c09daf86-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Each state has a body of law called its choice of law rules, which specify the circumstances in which courts of that state should follow laws of other jurisdictions, such as those of other states, federal law, or foreign law. Two inferences are possible from the <i>Erie</i> Court’s silence on this point. The Court might have thought it absolutely clear that New York courts would have applied Pennsylvania law, or the Court might have thought that the New York conflict of laws rules were irrelevant.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09daf87-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A few years after <i>Erie</i> came Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487 (1941), in which the Supreme Court applied <i>Erie</i> principles to conflicts rules: Under <i>Erie</i> a federal court sitting in diversity must apply the conflicts principles of the <i>forum state</i> (legal jargon for the state in which the court sits: In <i>Erie</i>, New York was the forum state).</p></li>

Subsequent cases have, however, suggested that the Supreme Court thinks <i>Klaxon</i> well embedded. Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612 (1964) (holding that even when a case is transferred to a federal court in another state it “takes with it” the substantive law and choice of law rules of the state where it was originally filed).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09daf89-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much of the Court’s discussion in <i>Erie</i> is devoted to the evils of forum shopping. By “forum shopping” the Court seems to mean the practice of a litigant’s selecting one rather than another court in which to sue, in the hope that the court will in some way treat the litigant more favorably than another court that might have heard the case. For example, under <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> there were several circumstances in which federal courts would enforce contracts that state courts would have refused to enforce. In such an instance, a plaintiff hoping to enforce such an agreement would “shop” for a forum (in this case the federal courts) that would enforce it.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c09daf8a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What’s wrong with different outcomes? If a federal judge believes that she has come up with the proper solution to a particular legal problem, doesn’t it deny justice to the parties to rule to the contrary simply to imitate the state court’s predicted result?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09daf8b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What’s wrong with forum shopping? <i>Erie</i> seems to assume that forum shopping between state and federal courts is the major problem. At the time of <i>Erie</i>, Tompkins could have sued the railroad in Pennsylvania, in New York, and perhaps in several other states where it did business; each of those states would likely have taken a slightly different approach to his case. Seven years after <i>Erie</i>, the Court decided <i>International Shoe</i>, thus giving its constitutional blessing to an extended jurisdictional reach for state courts. With this extension, plaintiffs will often have a choice of several different states in which to sue a defendant, and those states may have different substantive laws. Moreover, the parties’ lawyers have a duty to their clients to find the forum most advantageous to them. So, one might understand <i>Erie</i> not as a demonization of forum shopping, but as a limitation on the power of federal courts to decide the law applicable to state law disputes.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09daf8c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Erie</i> was the first civil case heard by Judge Mandelbaum, the trial judge. Judge Mandelbaum was a product of New York machine politics and, over strong protest from the bar, was appointed to the bench by President Roosevelt. Before his appointment, Mandelbaum had visited the federal courthouse only once, to see what it looked like. His notes, penned in the margin of his copy of the Supreme Court’s <i>Erie</i> opinion and reported in Irving Younger, <i>Observation: What Happened in</i> Erie, 56 Tex. L. Rev. 1011, 1030 (1978), suggest a different perspective on the case: “Because the <i>Swift Tyson</i> case[,] although before this case I never knew of its existence to be truthful[,] and for the confusion this decision brought about, it might have been better to leave it alone and stand by good old Swifty.”</p></li>

<p id="c09daf90-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Erie</i>—decided in 1938—changed the way federal courts thought about judge-made law. The same year brought another, even bigger, change: 1938 was the year in which the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure became effective. As you will see throughout this course, those rules transformed procedure in many ways. You may have wondered what procedures the federal courts followed before the Rules. The answer comes in two tiers. A federal statute, known as the Conformity Act, ordered the federal courts to follow whatever procedural rules existed in the state where the federal court sat. So a federal court in New York would follow New York procedural rules and a federal court in California would follow that state’s procedural regime<i>—mostly</i>. It’s “mostly” because alongside the state procedures decreed by the Conformity Act existed a separate set of rules for the federal courts when they were “sitting in equity"—considering whether to order an injunction or establish a receivership, to use two common examples. These separate equity rules were necessary because not all state courts had equitable jurisdiction. The Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. §2072, which empowered the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, also repealed the Conformity Act and “merged” law and equity, making separate equity rules unnecessary. And—that same year saw <i>Erie</i>, which overruled <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> and the regime it represented. One imagines a lot of lawyers staying up late on many nights trying to understand the brave new world they had entered.</p>

<p id="c09dd6a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having struggled with the constitutional ambiguities, you may be distressed to learn that, constitutional basis aside, <i>Erie</i> was an easy case for the application of the principle it announced. The remainder of this chapter will consider decisions in which the issue is how to apply the <i>Erie</i> doctrine—decisions that require a more subtle look at what that case held.</p>
<p id="c09dd6a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Erie</i> established that federal courts sitting in diversity (or exercising supplemental jurisdiction) were bound to replicate state practice in some circumstances. Which circumstances? Though <i>Erie</i> did not say so, its setting suggested that at the very least federal courts sitting in diversity or exercising supplemental jurisdiction should observe state substantive law, whether made by legislatures or by courts. But what about other “laws"? For example, were federal courts sitting in diversity bound to apply state statutes of limitations? If the courts of the state in question did not generally enforce arbitration agreements, could federal courts nevertheless do so if authorized by a federal statute? If a suit in state court could <span title="268" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-268">p. 268</span>be decided only by a judge, was a federal court precluded from using a jury? If a state statute required personal service of process, did that requirement also apply to process served in a federal diversity action? If a state court were bound to refuse to honor a contractual forum selection clause, were federal courts sitting in that state required to do likewise? If a state legislature orders its appellate courts to reduce excessive damages awarded by juries, does a federal appellate court have the same power?</p>
<p id="c09dd6a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the years since <i>Erie</i>, the Supreme Court has addressed each of these questions (as well as others) in an effort to mediate between opposing principles: that <i>Erie</i> requires deference to state courts as lawmaking bodies; and that federal courts are an independent judicial system. Justice Reed’s concurrence in <i>Erie</i> raised but did not resolve the question: “The line between procedural and substantive law is hazy, but no one doubts federal power over procedure.” Notice that many of these questions involve issues that could be described as “procedural.” As you read the next cases, consider whether it is true that “no one doubts” federal power over procedure.</p>

<p id="c09dd6ad-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Plaintiffs sued a bond trustee in a federal diversity action alleging misrepresentation and breach of trust. New York substantive law governed. Defendant invoked the New York statute of limitations, which had run. Plaintiffs argued that the statute of limitations did not bar the suit because it was on the “equity side” of federal court. The courts of equity had traditionally considered the length of time elapsing between the maturing of a claim and the bringing of suit but had not thought themselves strictly bound by statutes of limitations. Referring to that equitable tradition, the Second Circuit ruled that plaintiffs’ suit was not barred. The Supreme Court disagreed.]</p>
<p id="c09dd6ae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our starting point must be the policy of federal jurisdiction which <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</i> embodies. In overruling <i>Swift v. Tyson</i>, <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</i> did not merely overrule a venerable case. It overruled a particular way of looking at law which dominated the judicial process long after its inadequacies had been laid bare. Law was conceived as a “brooding omnipresence” of Reason, of which decisions were merely evidence and not themselves the controlling formulations. Accordingly, federal courts deemed themselves free to ascertain what Reason, and therefore Law, required wholly independent of authoritatively declared State law, even in cases where a legal right as the basis for relief was created by State authority and could not be created by federal authority and the case got into a federal court merely because it was “between Citizens of different States” under Art. III, §2 of the Constitution of the United States. . . . </p>
<p id="c09dfdbf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="269" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-269">p. 269</span>This case reduces itself to the narrow question whether, when no recovery could be had in a State court because the action is barred by the statute of limitations, a federal court in equity can take cognizance of the suit because there is diversity of citizenship between the parties. . . . </p>
<p id="c09dfdc0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And so the question is not whether a statute of limitations is deemed a matter of “procedure” in some sense. The question is whether such a statute concerns merely the manner and the means by which a right to recover, as recognized by the State, is enforced, or whether such statutory limitation is a matter of substance in the aspect that alone is relevant to our problem, namely, does it significantly affect the result of a litigation for a federal court to disregard a law of a State that would be controlling in an action upon the same claim by the same parties in a State court?</p>
<p id="c09dfdc1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is therefore immaterial whether statutes of limitation are characterized either as “substantive” or “procedural” in State court opinions in any use of those terms unrelated to the specific issue before us. <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</i> was not an endeavor to formulate scientific legal terminology. It expressed a policy that touches vitally the proper distribution of judicial power between State and federal courts. In essence, the intent of that decision was to insure that, in all cases where a federal court is exercising jurisdiction solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties, the outcome of the litigation in the federal court should be substantially the same, so far as legal rules determine the outcome of a litigation, as it would be if tried in a State court. . . . </p>

<li class=""><p id="c09dfdc9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even in the midst of this attack, however, Justice Frankfurter conceded that federal courts need not follow state law that “concern[ed] merely the manner and means by which a right to recover is. . . . enforced.” Isn’t this conceding that Justice Reed was right?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09dfdca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you read the rest of the cases in the <i>Erie</i> line, consider whether they don’t come down to the question of defining “the manner and means by which a right to recover is. . . . enforced.” (A procedure casebook can be excused for omitting “merely” from the phrase.)</p></li>

What does that mean? The standard paper sizes are 8 1/2” × 11” and 8 1/2” × 14". If a litigant offered the clerk of a federal district court a complaint typed on 8 1/2 × 14-inch paper, but the clerk refused to accept it on the grounds that the rules required shorter paper and the filing cabinets couldn’t hold paper 14 inches long, would you call the rule invoked by the clerk substantive because it was outcome-determinative? After all, the plaintiff might very well win in state court but can hardly win in federal court if the complaint can’t be filed. If you conclude that the “paper size” rule is not substantive for <i>Erie</i> purposes, how would you modify the outcome-determinative rule to exclude cases of this sort?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09e24dc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Guaranty Trust</i> not only decided a lawsuit; it also asserted that <i>Erie</i> marked a revolution in legal thought, a rejection of “Law. . . . as a ’brooding omnipresence’ of Reason,” a view presumably attributed to those judges (perhaps especially to Justice Story) who had adhered to <i>Swift v. Tyson</i>. <i>Erie</i> and <i>Guaranty Trust</i> asserted that such a view was not only jurisprudentially bankrupt but historically false—that the understanding of the Rules of Decision Act held by its framers was in accordance with that enunciated by <i>Guaranty Trust</i> and <i>Erie</i>. That understanding exercised a powerful influence over the <i>Erie</i> line of cases following <i>Guaranty Trust.</i> Consider four such cases.</p>

<p id="c09e7220-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The respondent argues that this state-court decision governs the present diversity case and “divests the jury of its normal function” to decide the disputed fact question of the respondent’s immunity under §72-111. This is to contend that the federal court is bound under <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</i> to follow the state court’s holding to secure uniform enforcement of the immunity created by the State.</p>
<p id="c09e7221-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>First</i>. It was decided in <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</i> that the federal courts in diversity cases must respect the definition of state-created rights and obligations by the state courts. We must, therefore, first examine the rule in <i>Adams v. Davison-Paxon Co</i>. to determine whether it is bound up with these rights and obligations in such a way that its application in the federal court is required.</p>
<p id="c09e7222-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Workmen’s Compensation Act is administered in South Carolina by its Industrial Commission. The South Carolina courts hold that, on judicial review of actions of the Commission under §72-111, the question whether the claim of an <span title="273" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-273">p. 273</span>injured workman is within the Commission’s jurisdiction is a matter of law for decision by the court, which makes its own findings of fact relating to that jurisdiction. The South Carolina Supreme Court states no reasons in <i>Adams v. Davison-Paxon Co</i>. why, although the jury decides all other factual issues raised by the cause of action and defenses, the jury is displaced as to the factual issue raised by the affirmative defense under §72-111. . . . We find nothing to suggest that this rule was announced as an integral part of the special relationship created by the statute. Thus the requirement appears to be merely a form and mode of enforcing the immunity, <i>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York</i>, and not a rule intended to be bound up with the definition of the rights and obligations of the parties. . . . </p>
<p id="c09e7223-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Second</i>. But cases following <i>Erie</i> have evinced a broader policy to the effect that the federal courts should conform as near as may be—in the absence of other considerations—to state rules even of form and mode where the state rules may bear substantially on the question whether the litigation would come out one way in the federal court and another way in the state court if the federal court failed to apply a particular local rule. E.g., <i>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York</i>; <i>Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co</i>. Concededly the nature of the tribunal which tries issues may be important in the enforcement of the parcel of rights making up a cause of action or defense, and bear significantly upon achievement of uniform enforcement of the right. It may well be that in the instant personal-injury case the outcome would be substantially affected by whether the issue of immunity is decided by a judge or a jury. Therefore, were “outcome” the only consideration, a strong case might appear for saying that the federal court should follow the state practice.</p>
<p id="c09e7224-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But there are affirmative countervailing considerations at work here. The federal system is an independent system for administering justice to litigants who properly invoke its jurisdiction. An essential characteristic of that system is the manner in which, in civil common-law actions, it distributes trial functions between judge and jury and, under the influence—if not the command<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1057B_d543b178-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1057B_d543b178-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">10</a></span>—of the Seventh Amendment, assigns the decisions of disputed questions of fact to the jury.

It cannot be gainsaid that there is a strong federal policy against allowing state rules to disrupt the judge-jury relationship in the federal courts. . . . Perhaps even more clearly in light of the influence of the Seventh Amendment, the function assigned to the jury “is an essential factor in the process for which the­ ­Federal Constitution provides.”  . . . </p>

We have discussed the problem upon the assumption that the outcome of the litigation may be substantially affected by whether the issue of immunity is decided by a judge or a jury. But clearly there is not present here the certainty that a different result would follow, cf. <i>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York</i>, supra, or even the strong possibility that this would be the case. There are factors present here which might reduce that possibility. The trial judge in the federal system has powers denied the judges of many States to comment on the weight of evidence and credibility of witnesses, and discretion to grant a new trial if the verdict appears to him to be against the weight of the evidence. We do not think the likelihood of a different result is so strong as to require the federal practice of jury determination of disputed factual issues to yield to the state rule in the interest of uniformity of outcome. . . . </p>

The defendant was the estate of one of the drivers involved. The issue arose because Massachusetts law provided that suits against an estate required personal service of process on the estate’s executor. Process was instead served under Rule 4[(e)(2)(B)], which allowed for the summons and complaint to be left with a competent adult at the residence of any defendant. Defendant was served by leaving the summons and complaint with his wife at his residence. The district court and First Circuit, citing <i>Ragan</i> (see the chart in Note 3 supra page 270), ruled that the claim should be dismissed because plaintiff had failed to comply with the state method of serving process within the applicable statute of limitations.]</p>
<p id="c09ec059-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the adoption of Rule 4[(e)(2)(B)], designed to control service of process in diversity actions, neither exceeded the congressional mandate embodied in the Rules Enabling Act nor transgressed constitutional bounds, and that the Rule is therefore the standard against which the District Court should have measured the adequacy of the service.

<p id="c09ee76e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the cases construing the scope of the Enabling Act, Rule 4[(e)(2)(B)] clearly passes muster. Prescribing the manner in which a defendant is to be notified that a suit has been instituted against him, it relates to the “practice and procedure of the district courts.” “The test must be whether a rule really regulates procedure—the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.” <i>Sibbach v. Wilson &amp; Co</i>. . . . </p>
<p id="c09ee76f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, were there no conflicting state procedure, Rule 4[(e)(2)(B)] would clearly control. However, respondent, focusing on the contrary Massachusetts rule, calls to the Court’s attention another line of cases, a line which—like the Federal Rules—had its birth in 1938. <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</i>, overruling <i>Swift v. Tyson</i>, held that federal courts sitting in diversity cases, when deciding questions of “substantive” law, are <span title="276" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-276">p. 276</span>bound by state court decisions as well as state statutes. The broad command of <i>Erie</i> was therefore identical to that of the Enabling Act: federal courts are to apply state substantive law and federal procedural law. However, as subsequent cases sharpened the distinction between substance and procedure, the line of cases following <i>Erie</i> diverged markedly from the line construing the Enabling Act. . . . </p>
<p id="c09ee770-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent, by placing primary reliance on <i>York</i> and <i>Ragan</i>, suggests that the <i>Erie</i> doctrine acts as a check on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that despite the clear command of Rule 4[(e)(2)(B)], <i>Erie</i> and its progeny demand the application of the Massachusetts rule. . . . </p>
<p id="c09ee771-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the first place, it is doubtful that, even if there were no Federal Rule making it clear that in-hand service is not required in diversity actions, the <i>Erie</i> rule would have obligated the District Court to follow the Massachusetts procedure. “Outcome-determination” analysis was never intended to serve as a talisman. <i>Byrd v. Blue Ridge Cooperative</i>. Indeed, the message of <i>York</i> itself is that choices between state and federal law are to be made not by application of any automatic, “litmus paper” criterion, but rather by reference to the policies underlying the <i>Erie</i> rule.</p>
<p id="c09ee772-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Erie</i> rule is rooted in part in a realization that it would be unfair for the character or result of a litigation materially to differ because the suit had been brought in a federal court. . . . The decision was also in part a reaction to the practice of “forum-shopping” which had grown up in response to the rule of <i>Swift v. Tyson</i>. That the <i>York</i> test was an attempt to effectuate these policies is demonstrated by the fact that the opinion framed the inquiry in terms of “substantial” variations between state and federal litigation. Not only are nonsubstantial, or trivial, variations not likely to raise the sort of constitutional problems which troubled the Court in <i>Erie</i>; they are also unlikely to influence the choice of a forum. The “outcome-determination” test therefore cannot be read without reference to the twin aims of the <i>Erie</i> rule: discouragement of forum-shopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws.</p>
<p id="c09ee773-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difference between the conclusion that the Massachusetts rule is applicable, and the conclusion that it is not, is of course at this point “outcome-determinative” in the sense that if we hold the state rule to apply, respondent prevails, whereas if we hold that Rule 4[(e)(2)(B)] governs, the litigation will continue. But in this sense <i>every</i> procedural variation is “outcome-determinative.. . . . [I]t is difficult to argue that permitting service of defendant’s wife to take the place of in-hand service of defendant himself alters the mode of enforcement of state-created rights in a fashion sufficiently “substantial” to raise the sort of equal protection problems to which the <i>Erie</i> opinion alluded.</p>
<p id="c09ee774-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is, however, a more fundamental flaw in respondent’s syllogism: the incorrect assumption that the rule of <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</i> constitutes the appropriate test of the validity and therefore the applicability of a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. The <i>Erie</i> rule has never been invoked to void a Federal Rule. It is true that there have been cases where this Court has held applicable a state rule in the face of an argument that the situation was governed by one of the Federal Rules. But the holding of each such case was not that <i>Erie</i> commanded displacement of a Federal Rule by an inconsistent state rule, but rather that the scope of the Federal Rule was not as broad as the losing party urged, and therefore, there being no Federal Rule which covered the point in dispute, <i>Erie</i> commanded the enforcement of state law. . . . (Here, of course, the clash is unavoidable; Rule 4[(e)(2)(B)] says—implicitly, but with unmistakable clarity—that in-hand service is not required in federal courts.) At the same <span title="277" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-277">p. 277</span>time, in cases adjudicating the validity of Federal Rules, we have not applied the <i>York</i> rule or other refinements of <i>Erie</i>, but have to this day continued to decide questions concerning the scope of the Enabling Act and the constitutionality of specific Federal Rules in light of the distinction set forth in <i>Sibbach</i>.</p>
<p id="c09ee775-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor has the development of two separate lines of cases been inadvertent. The line between “substance” and “procedure” shifts as the legal context changes. . . . It is true that both the Enabling Act and the <i>Erie</i> rule say, roughly, that federal courts are to apply state “substantive” law and federal “procedural” law, but from that it need not follow that the tests are identical. For they were designed to control very different sorts of decisions. When a situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules, the question facing the court is a far cry from the typical, relatively unguided <i>Erie</i> choice: the court has been instructed to apply the Federal Rule, and can refuse to do so only if the Advisory Committee, this Court, and Congress erred in their prima facie judgment that the Rule in question transgresses neither the terms of the Enabling Act nor constitutional restrictions. . . . </p>
<p id="c09ee776-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Erie</i> and its offspring cast no doubt on the long-recognized power of Congress to prescribe housekeeping rules for federal courts even though some of those rules will inevitably differ from comparable state rules. . . . Thus, though a court, in measuring a Federal Rule against the standards contained in the Enabling Act and the Constitution, need not wholly blind itself to the degree to which the Rule makes the character and result of the federal litigation stray from the course it would follow in state courts, it cannot be forgotten that the <i>Erie</i> rule, and the guidelines suggested in <i>York</i>, were created to serve another purpose altogether. To hold that a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure must cease to function whenever it alters the mode of enforcing state-created rights would be to disembowel either the Constitution’s grant of power over federal procedure or Congress’ attempt to exercise that power in the Enabling Act. Rule 4[(e)(2)(B)] is valid and controls the instant case.</p>

I have always regarded that decision as one of the modern cornerstones of our federalism, expressing policies that profoundly touch the allocation of judicial power between the state and federal systems. <i>Erie</i> recognized that there should not be two conflicting systems of law controlling the primary activity of citizens, for such alternative governing authority must necessarily give rise to a debilitating uncertainty in the planning of everyday affairs.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106EA_d543b178-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N106EA_d543b178-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span> And it recognized that the scheme of our Constitution envisions an allocation of law-making functions between state and federal legislative processes which is undercut <span title="278" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-278">p. 278</span>if the federal judiciary can make substantive law affecting state affairs beyond the bounds of congressional legislative powers in this regard. Thus, in diversity cases <i>Erie</i> commands that it be the state law governing primary private activity which prevails.</p>
<p id="c09f0e8c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The shorthand formulations which have appeared in some past decisions are prone to carry untoward results that frequently arise from oversimplification. . . . To my mind the proper line of approach in determining whether to apply a state or a federal rule, whether “substantive” or “procedural,” is to stay close to basic principles by inquiring if the choice of rule would substantially affect those primary decisions respecting human conduct which our constitutional system leaves to state regulation. If so, <i>Erie</i> and the Constitution require that the state rule prevail, even in the face of a conflicting federal rule.</p>
<p id="c09f0e8d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court weakens, if indeed it does not submerge, this basic principle by finding, in effect, a grant of substantive legislative power in the constitutional provision for a federal court system, and through it, setting up the Federal Rules as a body of law inviolate. . . . So long as a reasonable man could characterize any duly adopted federal rule as “procedural,” the Court, unless I misapprehend what is said, would have it apply no matter how seriously it frustrated a State’s substantive regulation of the primary conduct and affairs of its citizens. Since the members of the Advisory Committee, the Judicial Conference, and this Court who formulated the Federal Rules are presumably reasonable men, it follows that the integrity of the Federal Rules is absolute. Whereas the unadulterated outcome and forum-shopping tests may err too far toward honoring state rules, I submit that the Court’s “arguably procedural, ergo constitutional” test moves too fast and far in the other direction. . . . </p>

In fact, no case has ever held a Rule to be beyond the scope of the Rules Enabling Act, though some have suggested that particular Rules (e.g., Rules 23, 68) come close to the line. Nor has any Rule ever been held unconstitutional, though several have been revised in light of constitutional developments that might have made them subject to attack. See, for example, Rule 65(b), which was revised in the wake of due process cases like <i>Fuentes v. Shevin</i>, infra page 324. Does this record prove Harlan correct?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c09f5cc4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another might be differences in the manner in which prospective jurors were questioned: Many states, either by law or custom, permit extensive conversations between jurors and lawyers during jury selection; no statute or Rule governs the matter, but in many federal courts judges do all the questioning and do so very quickly.

<li class=""><p id="c09f5cc5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Byrd</i> and <i>Hanna</i> would approach that question in different ways. <i>Byrd</i> asks whether the practice in question is “bound up with the substantive rights and obligations created by state law” and, if not, whether there is a countervailing interest inherent in the federal system. In the case of the voir dire practice, the answer to the first question will almost always be “no” and to the second “yes.” <i>Hanna</i> asks first whether the practice in question flows from a Rule (no, for voir dire) and, if not, whether following the federal rule would lead to forum shopping or inequitable administration of the law. For voir dire, the answer is uncertain (in some cases, one can imagine a lawyer believing it very important to get a good feel for the jury); if, however, the answer is no (that lawyers wouldn’t choose between state and federal court over such a matter), then <i>Hanna</i> arrives at the same outcome—follow federal voir dire practice—by a different route than <i>Byrd.</i></p></li>

<p id="c09f5cc9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In your Constitutional Law course, you will study federal “preemption,” a phrase used to describe what happens when federal law occupies a space so completely that it “preempts,” that is, displaces or pushes out state law that might otherwise govern. For example, if ­Congress today passed a statute defining the law of trespass on the tracks of railroads in interstate commerce, that federal statute would preempt the state law that would otherwise govern. It may <span title="281" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-281">p. 281</span>be helpful to think of <i>Hanna</i> as a preemption case: When a federal statute or Rule defines procedure in some area, that federal law preempts state law that might otherwise govern.</p>
<p id="c09f5cca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For federal law to preempt, the federal law must be constitutional and otherwise valid. To preempt, according to standard doctrine, a federal law must in some sense be intended to displace state law. <i>Hanna</i>’s requirement that a Rule must be valid under the Rules Enabling Act sets forth a test of validity for a Rule—a precondition for its preemptive power.</p>
<p id="c09f5ccb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Byrd</i> deals with a softer form of preemption, in which there is no explicit statute or Rule that displaces state practice, only a “custom.” <i>Byrd</i>’s underlying idea seems to be that for the federal courts to constitute an independent judicial system, they must be free to adopt a series of such “practices” (<i>Byrd</i> called them “affirmative countervailing considerations”), even when they depart from what a state court would do. Those might include a number of small matters: <i>Byrd</i> thus protects a number of such small customs that do not rise to the level of law, allowing them to displace analogous state court customs that diverge from their federal counterparts.</p>

<p id="c09f83ee-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under <i>Hanna</i>’s reading of <i>Erie</i>, many “<i>Erie</i>” questions will not require resorting to the Constitution because Congress by statute or Rule will have told federal courts what to do in the situation. So long as the statute is constitutional (and the Rule conforms to the Rules Enabling Act), the choice of law problem is solved: Federal procedure governs. The difficulty arises when a federal court has to decide whether a federal statute that <i>might</i> occupy the area really does or when, by contrast, a federal statute or Rule should be construed not to conflict with a state practice. A number of pre-<i>Hanna</i> cases, described supra at pages 270-71, raised this issue. Consider some post-<i>Hanna</i> examples.</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="c09f83ef-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 allows—but does not require—an appellate court to punish frivolous appeals with extra costs. Alabama had a statute that automatically added a 10 percent penalty to an unsuccessful appeal of an award of money damages. In Burlington Northern R. v. Woods, 480 U.S. 1 (1987), the Court held that the federal Rule governed in federal courts, reasoning that the discretionary character of Appellate Rule 38 clashed with the mandatory state statute.</p></li>
<li><p id="c09f83f0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">States have varied in their willingness to enforce forum selection clauses. Alabama had a statute making such a clause unenforceable; did that statute govern in federal diversity litigation? No, said Stewart Org. v. Ricoh, 487 U.S. 22 (1988). The state statute was displaced by 28 U.S.C. §1404 (which you met in Chapter 2), which gives the federal courts discretionary power to move litigation to another district in the interests of justice and for the convenience of the parties. The <i>Stewart</i> Court said that a federal court considering such a transfer motion should weigh all the factors, including the forum selection clause, rather than giving automatic effect to the state’s ban of forum selection clauses. <i>Atlantic Marine Construction</i> (supra page 195) suggests that such forum selection clauses should in most cases be enforced—via §1404.</p></li>
<li><p id="c09fab01-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By contrast, Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415 (1996), struggled to accommodate both state and federal interests. The Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment prohibits federal Circuit Courts of Appeals from re-examining jury verdicts except as permitted at common law. A New York statute required state appellate courts to decide if jury damage awards exceeded “reasonable compensation” and to adjust them downward if they did. The U.S. Supreme Court held that both state and federal interests could be accommodated by allowing the federal <i>district</i> courts to conduct such reviews.</p></li>
<li><p id="c09fab02-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">New York has a statute prohibiting class actions that aggregate statutory penalties—so under New York law an individual can sue for a $1,000 statutory penalty, but ten thousand such persons cannot sue as a class, seeking $10,000,000 in damages. In Shady Grove Orthopedic Assoc., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), the Court held that Federal Rule 23, which defines the requirements for bringing federal class actions, displaced <span title="283" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-283">p. 283</span>the state statute. As the majority saw it, Rule 23 sets forth the requirements for class certification; because it says nothing about forbidding classes seeking to aggregate statutory penalties, a federal court deciding whether to certify a class should focus exclusively on the Rule’s requirements. In dissent, Justice Ginsburg, the author of <i>Gasperini</i>, argued that it would be possible to accommodate both the Rule and the state statute, by permitting a class action, but not a class seeking to aggregate statutory penalties.</p></li>
<li><p id="c09fab03-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Erie</i> line of cases reaches into several areas of procedural law. One, that we’ll note here but reserve for a later chapter, is how it interacts with the law of former adjudication. Recall from Chapter 1 (<i>Ison v. Thomas</i>) that both state and federal courts have created a law of claim and issue preclusion: Very roughly speaking, a litigant who has brought a case in which a judgment has been entered cannot bring the same case again. But because each state (and the federal system) has its own common law of preclusion, the exact scope of preclusion can vary a bit: A claim that California would preclude from relitigation might not be barred had it been decided in, say, Maryland. To add a wrinkle to this idea, suppose the second case is brought not in California but in Maryland. As you will see in Chapter 11, Maryland would look to California law in deciding the scope of preclusion of the first, California, case. But—to take matters into <i>Erie</i>-land—suppose the first case was decided in California by a <i>federal</i> court sitting in diversity jurisdiction. In Semtek Intl. Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U.S. 497 (2001), the Supreme Court held that the scope of a federal judgment rendered in diversity should be the same as that judgment <i>would have had if it had been rendered by a state court</i> of the state where the federal court was sitting. In the hypothetical (which tracks the facts of <i>Semtek</i>), that would mean that the scope of a judgment of a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction in California should be the same as it would be had the action been brought in a California state court. Stay tuned for Chapter 11.</p></li>

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c09fab05-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"><i>Note: Interpreting State Law: An Entailment of Erie</i></p></h3></div>

<p id="c09fab06-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Erie</i> requires federal courts sitting in diversity to apply state law under various circumstances. Sometimes, it will be easy for federal courts to determine state law: A recent state supreme court case may have carefully defined it, or the matter may be covered in an authoritative statute.</p>
<p id="c09fab07-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But determining state law can sometimes be difficult. What happens if there is no precedent on point, or the only available precedent is some years old, and the area of law has recently shown signs of change? Or what if the question is complicated by a horizontal choice of law problem like the one that brought forth Judge Henry Friendly’s quip: “Our principal task, in this diversity of citizenship case, is <span title="284" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-284">p. 284</span>to determine what the New York courts would think the California courts would think on an issue about which neither has thought.” Nolan v. Transocean Air Lines, 276 F.2d 280, 281 (2d Cir. 1960). For a state trial judge, such uncertainty presents difficulties, but she at least has the assurance that if she is wrong, the state appellate courts will straighten things out. Federal judges, compelled to follow <i>Erie</i>, generally lack that assurance, because a federal court’s erroneous interpretation of state law cannot be appealed to a state court.</p>
<p id="c09fab08-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What, then, should the federal district judge do? Should she predict what the state court would probably do under such circumstances? Should she act as she thinks a state court should act in these circumstances, even if she thinks it would not behave that way? For that matter, which state court should the federal district court seek to resemble—the state trial court, which is often hesitant to depart from precedent—or the state supreme court?</p>
<p id="c09fab09-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same predicament faces the federal courts of appeals. On appeal from the district court’s judgment, a federal court of appeals must do its best to decide what the state appellate courts would do when faced with the same appeal. Nor may the courts of appeals simply defer to the district court—on the ground that a district court judge from that state has a better feel for his own state’s law. Salve Regina College v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225 (1991) (federal court of appeals required to review de novo district court’s determination of state law).</p>
<p id="c09fab0a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under such circumstances, one finds federal courts of appeals making such statements as, “Because we are persuaded by a careful review of the Ohio decisional law, as well as other relevant sources,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108FE_d543b178-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N108FE_d543b178-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*3</a></span> that the Supreme Court of Ohio would not construe its statute of limitations so as to preclude recovery in this case, we [do likewise].” McKenna v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., 622 F.2d 657, 659 (3d Cir. 1980). Holdings based on such predictions of state court views are awkward, especially if the predictions later turn out to be wrong.</p>
<p id="c09fab0c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider, for example, the tangle in Pierce v. Cook &amp; Co., 518 F.2d 720 (10th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1079 (1976). Driver and three passengers were involved in a collision with a truck driven by an independent contractor hauling wheat for Cook. Driver and Passengers each brought actions. Two of the suits were removed to federal courts; the third remained in state court. In the federal court actions defendants won a summary judgment on the basis of 30-year-old state-law precedent relieving Cook of responsibility for the negligence of an independent contractor; the case was affirmed on appeal. Meanwhile, the state trial court had also granted summary judgment—on the basis of the same precedent—but plaintiff appealed to the state supreme court, which overruled the precedent. The state supreme court decision became final more than three years after the original federal appeal.</p>
<p id="c09fab0d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Six months later, the two federal plaintiffs moved to vacate the federal appellate decision under Rule 60(b), which permits the reopening of a final judgment under limited circumstances. See Chapter 11. In setting aside the federal judgment, the <span title="285" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-285">p. 285</span>court of appeals emphasized that there had been “divergent results from a common vehicular accident,” that plaintiffs had been forced into the federal courts, and that plaintiffs had received substantially different results in the federal courts than they would have in the state courts, in violation of the <i>Erie</i> principle.</p>
<p id="c09fab0e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contrast <i>Pierce</i> with DeWeerth v. Baldinger, 38 F.3d 1266 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1001 (1994). In 1987, plaintiff invoked diversity jurisdiction to sue a New York art dealer to recover a Monet painting stolen from his family during World War II. The federal court ruled that DeWeerth had failed to satisfy what it understood to be the showing of reasonable diligence in locating stolen property required by state law. Four years later the New York courts in a similar case held that a showing of reasonable diligence was not required under the relevant statute. DeWeerth moved to reopen his federal judgment under Rule 60(b), the same Rule used in <i>Pierce</i>. The Second Circuit sharply rejected the attempt:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c09fab0f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Erie</i> simply does not stand for the proposition that a plaintiff is entitled to reopen a federal court case that has been closed for several years in order to gain the benefit of a newly announced decision of a state court, a forum in which she specifically declined to litigate her claim.</p>
</div>
<p id="c09fab10-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In an effort to render cases like <i>Pierce</i> and <i>DeWeerth</i> less frequent, several states have adopted a process called <i>certification</i>. In certification the federal court asks the state supreme court for an answer to a question about state law. In cases like <i>Pierce</i> and <i>DeWeerth</i>, if the state appellate court announced that it was changing the law, a federal diversity court could do likewise. There are, however, several defects in this system. First, the state must have a certification procedure; some do not. Even when the procedure is available and is used, the results are not always satisfactory. Sometimes state courts do not accept the invitation to answer the question about state law. Other times they answer, but in terms that leave the federal courts as perplexed as they were before. Part of the problem flows from the circumstance that the certification process does not simply pass the whole case to the state supreme court (as review, explain why that would violate the premise of diversity jurisdiction). Instead, the federal court frames a question of law that it asks the state court to clarify. But, in a common law system, legal issues often lie deeply embedded in factual contexts, so it is entirely possible for a state court to “answer” a question about state law but leave the federal court entirely unsure how to apply it to the case at hand.</p>

<p id="c09ff948-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q1.</b>  A, B, C, and D are all correct responses. A is correct because the “Conformity Act,” repealed when the Federal Rules came into effect in 1938 (the same year as <i>Erie</i>), directed the federal courts to follow the procedural law of the state in which the federal court sat. B is correct—then as now: When federal substantive law governs, a federal court will apply it. C is correct, at least in cases governed by “general law”: That’s the holding of <i>Swift v. Tyson</i>. D is correct because that’s how <i>Swift</i> interpreted the Rules of Decision Act, and that interpretation stood until it was overruled in <i>Erie.</i></p>
<p id="c09ff949-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q2.</b>  C is the only correct response. C is correct because most commentators think the best explanation of <i>Erie</i>’s constitutional basis rests not on a specific clause but of constitutional “structure”: The Constitution assumes that states have broad lawmaking powers and that they’re entitled to let their courts (as well as their legislatures) do that lawmaking—and that the federal courts should respect their choices. A and B are wrong because the opinion nowhere references either of these clauses.</p>

A is wrong because the <i>Erie</i> principle will apply whenever state law supplies a claim or defense—as, for example, in a federal question case that includes state law claims brought in under supplemental jurisdiction. B is correct for the reasons explained in A. C is correct (that’s the holding of <i>Hanna v. Plumer</i>), though a careful lawyer would note that the courts have sometimes construed Rules in unexpected ways to avoid a conflict with state law (e.g., <i>Ragan v. Merchants Transfer</i>, noted at page 270, as well as <i>Semtek,</i> noted above). D is correct because that’s the holding of <i>Klaxon v. Stentor</i>, discussed at page 265.</p>
<p id="c09ff94b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4. </b> B and D are correct. A is wrong because the Court has faithfully adhered to its holding, even when sometimes disagreeing about the scope of that holding. C is wrong because when faced with such a collision, the Court has instead construed the Rule not to pose such a problem.</p>
